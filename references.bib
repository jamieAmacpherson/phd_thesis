@article{Hulme:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The focus of this review paper is factors affecting data interpretation in ligand binding assays under equilibrium conditions. Protocols for determining K(d) (the equilibrium dissociation constant) and K(dA) (the equilibrium inhibitor constant) for receptor ligands are discussed. The basic theory describing the interaction of a radiotracer and an unlabelled competitor ligand with a receptor is developed. Inappropriate experimental design may result in ligand depletion and non-attainment of equilibrium, distorting the calculation of K(d) and K(dA) . Strategies, both theoretical and practical, will be given to avoid and correct such errors, thus leading to the determination of reliable values for these constants. In determining K(dA) from competition binding studies, two additional concepts are discussed. First, the necessity to measure an adequate specific binding signal from the bound radiotracer ligand limits the range of affinity constants that can be measured: a particular set of assay conditions may lead to an upper limit on the apparent affinity of unlabelled ligands. Second, an extension of the basic assay methodology can indicate whether the interaction between the tracer and a test ligand is mediated by a competitive or an allosteric mechanism. Finally, the review ends with a discussion of two factors that are often overlooked: buffer composition and the temperature at which the assay is conducted, and the impact these can have on affinity measurements and the understanding of drug interactions.},

@article{Gasper:2012aa,
	Abstract = {The serine protease α-thrombin is a dual-action protein that mediates the blood-clotting cascade. Thrombin alone is a procoagulant, cleaving fibrinogen to make the fibrin clot, but the thrombin-thrombomodulin (TM) complex initiates the anticoagulant pathway by cleaving protein C. A TM fragment consisting of only the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains (TM56) is sufficient to bind thrombin, but the presence of the fourth EGF-like domain (TM456) is critical to induce the anticoagulant activity of thrombin. Crystallography of the thrombin-TM456 complex revealed no significant structural changes in thrombin, suggesting that TM4 may only provide a scaffold for optimal alignment of protein C for its cleavage by thrombin. However, a variety of experimental data have suggested that the presence of TM4 may affect the dynamic properties of the active site loops. In the present work, we have used both conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics simulation to study the structural dynamic properties of thrombin, thrombin:TM56, and thrombin:TM456 across a broad range of time scales. Two distinct yet interrelated allosteric pathways are identified that mediate both the pro- and anticoagulant activities of thrombin. One allosteric pathway, which is present in both thrombin:TM56 and thrombin:TM456, directly links the TM5 domain to the thrombin active site. The other allosteric pathway, which is only present on slow time scales in the presence of the TM4 domain, involves an extended network of correlated motions linking the TM4 and TM5 domains and the active site loops of thrombin.},

@article{McClendon:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Protein kinases are dynamically regulated signaling proteins that act as switches in the cell by phosphorylating target proteins. To establish a framework for analyzing linkages between structure, function, dynamics, and allostery in protein kinases, we carried out multiple microsecond-scale molecular-dynamics simulations of protein kinase A (PKA), an exemplar active kinase. We identified residue-residue correlated motions based on the concept of mutual information and used the Girvan-Newman method to partition PKA into structurally contiguous "communities." Most of these communities included 40-60 residues and were associated with a particular protein kinase function or a regulatory mechanism, and well-known motifs based on sequence and secondary structure were often split into different communities. The observed community maps were sensitive to the presence of different ligands and provide a new framework for interpreting long-distance allosteric coupling. Communication between different communities was also in agreement with the previously defined architecture of the protein kinase core based on the "hydrophobic spine" network. This finding gives us confidence in suggesting that community analyses can be used for other protein kinases and will provide an efficient tool for structural biologists. The communities also allow us to think about allosteric consequences of mutations that are linked to disease. },

@article{Vander-Heiden:2010aa,
	Abstract = {A common feature of tumors arising from diverse tissue types is a reliance on aerobic glycolysis for glucose metabolism. This metabolic difference between cancer cells and normal cells could be exploited for therapeutic benefit in patients. Cancer cells universally express the M2 isoform of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase ({PKM2}), and previous work has demonstrated that {PKM2} expression is necessary for aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in vivo. Because most normal tissues express an isoform of pyruvate kinase other than {PKM2}, selective targeting of {PKM2} provides an opportunity to target cell metabolism for cancer therapy. {PKM2} has an identical catalytic site as the related M1 splice variant (PKM1). However, isoform selective inhibition is possible as {PKM2} contains a unique region for allosteric regulation. We have screened a library of greater than 1,00,000 small molecules to identify such inhibitors. The inhibitors identified for {PKM2} fell primarily into three distinct structural classes. The most potent {PKM2} inhibitor resulted in decreased glycolysis and increased cell death following loss of growth factor signaling. At least part of this effect was due to on-target {PKM2} inhibition as less cell death was observed in cells engineered to express PKM1. These data suggest that isoform selective inhibition of {PKM2} with small molecules is feasible and support the hypothesis that inhibition of glucose metabolism in cancer cells is a viable strategy to treat human malignancy.},

	Abstract = {Directed in vitro evolution can create {RNA} catalysts for a variety of organic reactions, supporting the "RNA world" hypothesis, which proposes that metabolic transformations in early life were catalyzed by {RNA} molecules rather than proteins. Among the most fundamental carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions in nature is the aldol reaction, mainly catalyzed by aldolases that utilize either an enamine mechanism (class I) or a Zn(2+) cofactor (class II). We report on isolation of a Zn(2+)-dependent ribozyme that catalyzes an aldol reaction at its own modified 5' end with a 4300-fold rate enhancement over the uncatalyzed background reaction. The ribozyme can also act as an intermolecular catalyst that transfers a biotinylated benzaldehyde derivative to the aldol donor substrate, coupled to an external hexameric {RNA} oligonucleotide, supporting the existence of RNA-originated biosynthetic pathways for metabolic sugar precursors and other biomolecules.},

	Abstract = {The demonstration that ribosomal peptide synthesis is a ribozyme-catalyzed reaction makes it almost certain that there was once an {RNA} World. The central problem for origin-of-life studies, therefore, is to understand how a protein-free {RNA} World became established on the primitive Earth. We first review the literature on the prebiotic synthesis of the nucleotides, the nonenzymatic synthesis and copying of polynucleotides, and the selection of ribozyme catalysts of a kind that might have facilitated polynucleotide replication. This leads to a brief outline of the Molecular Biologists' Dream, an optimistic scenario for the origin of the {RNA} World. In the second part of the review we point out the many unresolved problems presented by the Molecular Biologists' Dream. This in turn leads to a discussion of genetic systems simpler than {RNA} that might have "invented" RNA. Finally, we review studies of prebiotic membrane formation.},

@article{Konhauser:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The enrichment of redox-sensitive trace metals in ancient marine sedimentary rocks has been used to determine the timing of the oxidation of the Earth's land surface. Chromium (Cr) is among the emerging proxies for tracking the effects of atmospheric oxygenation on continental weathering; this is because its supply to the oceans is dominated by terrestrial processes that can be recorded in the Cr isotope composition of Precambrian iron formations. However, the factors controlling past and present seawater Cr isotope composition are poorly understood. Here we provide an independent and complementary record of marine Cr supply, in the form of Cr concentrations and authigenic enrichment in iron-rich sedimentary rocks. Our data suggest that Cr was largely immobile on land until around 2.48 Gyr ago, but within the 160 Myr that followed--and synchronous with independent evidence for oxygenation associated with the Great Oxidation Event (see, for example, refs 4-6)--marked excursions in Cr content and Cr/Ti ratios indicate that Cr was solubilized at a scale unrivalled in history. As Cr isotope fractionations at that time were muted, Cr must have been mobilized predominantly in reduced, Cr(III), form. We demonstrate that only the oxidation of an abundant and previously stable crustal pyrite reservoir by aerobic-respiring, chemolithoautotrophic bacteria could have generated the degree of acidity required to solubilize Cr(III) from ultramafic source rocks and residual soils. This profound shift in weathering regimes beginning at 2.48 Gyr ago constitutes the earliest known geochemical evidence for acidophilic aerobes and the resulting acid rock drainage, and accounts for independent evidence of an increased supply of dissolved sulphate and sulphide-hosted trace elements to the oceans around that time. Our model adds to amassing evidence that the Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic boundary was marked by a substantial shift in terrestrial geochemistry and biology.},

@article{Tesileanu:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Statistical coupling analysis (SCA) is a method for analyzing multiple sequence alignments that was used to identify groups of coevolving residues termed "sectors". The method applies spectral analysis to a matrix obtained by combining correlation information with sequence conservation. It has been asserted that the protein sectors identified by SCA are functionally significant, with different sectors controlling different biochemical properties of the protein. Here we reconsider the available experimental data and note that it involves almost exclusively proteins with a single sector. We show that in this case sequence conservation is the dominating factor in SCA, and can alone be used to make statistically equivalent functional predictions. Therefore, we suggest shifting the experimental focus to proteins for which SCA identifies several sectors. Correlations in protein alignments, which have been shown to be informative in a number of independent studies, would then be less dominated by sequence conservation. },

Despite the growing number of online servers and databases devoted to prediction/classification of allosteric sites and their characteristics, there is a lack of resources for an efficient and quick estimation of the causality and energetics of allosteric communication.
Results: The AlloSigMA server implements a unique approach on the basis of the recently introduced structure-based statistical mechanical models of allosteric signaling. It provides an interactive framework for estimating the allosteric free energy as a result of the ligand(s) binding, mutation(s) and their combinations. Latent regulatory exosites and allosteric effect of mutations can be detected and explored, facilitating the research efforts in protein engineering and allosteric drug design.

@article{Tee:2018aa,
	Abstract = {The omnipresence of allosteric regulation together with the fundamental role of structural dynamics in this phenomenon have initiated a great interest to the detection of regulatory exosites and design of corresponding effectors. However, despite a general consensus on the key role of dynamics most of the earlier efforts on the prediction of allosteric sites are heavily crippled by the static nature of the underlying methods, which are either structure-based approaches seeking for deep surface pockets typical for "traditional" orthosteric drugs or sequence-based techniques exploiting the conservation of protein sequences. Because of the critical role of global protein dynamics in allosteric signaling, we investigate the hypothesis of reversibility in allosteric communication, according to which allosteric sites can be detected via the perturbation of the functional sites. The reversibility is tested here using our structure-based perturbation model of allostery, which allows one to analyze the causality and energetics of allosteric communication. We validate the "reverse perturbation" hypothesis and its predictive power on a set of classical allosteric proteins, then, on the independent extended benchmark set. We also show that, in addition to known allosteric sites, the perturbation of the functional sites unravels rather extended protein regions, which can host latent regulatory exosites. These protein parts that are dynamically coupled with functional sites can also be used for inducing and tuning allosteric communication, and an exhaustive exploration of the per-residue contributions to allosteric effects can eventually lead to the optimal modulation of protein activity. The site-effector interactions necessary for a specific mode and level of allosteric communication can be fine-tuned by adjusting the site's structure to an available effector molecule and by the design or selection of an appropriate ligand.},

	Abstract = {Understanding and predicting protein structures depends on the complexity and the accuracy of the models used to represent them. We have set up a hidden Markov model that discretizes protein backbone conformation as series of overlapping fragments (states) of four residues length. This approach learns simultaneously the geometry of the states and their connections. We obtain, using a statistical criterion, an optimal systematic decomposition of the conformational variability of the protein peptidic chain in 27 states with strong connection logic. This result is stable over different protein sets. Our model fits well the previous knowledge related to protein architecture organisation and seems able to grab some subtle details of protein organisation, such as helix sub-level organisation schemes. Taking into account the dependence between the states results in a description of local protein structure of low complexity. On an average, the model makes use of only 8.3 states among 27 to describe each position of a protein structure. Although we use short fragments, the learning process on entire protein conformations captures the logic of the assembly on a larger scale. Using such a model, the structure of proteins can be reconstructed with an average accuracy close to 1.1A root-mean-square deviation and for a complexity of only 3. Finally, we also observe that sequence specificity increases with the number of states of the structural alphabet. Such models can constitute a very relevant approach to the analysis of protein architecture in particular for protein structure prediction.},

	Abstract = {A novel scheme is introduced to capture the spatial correlations of consecutive amino acids in naturally occurring proteins. This knowledge-based strategy is able to carry out optimally automated subdivisions of protein fragments into classes of similarity. The goal is to provide the minimal set of protein oligomers (termed "oligons" for brevity) that is able to represent any other fragment. At variance with previous studies in which recurrent local motifs were classified, our concern is to provide simplified protein representations that have been optimised for use in automated folding and/or design attempts. In such contexts, it is paramount to limit the number of degrees of freedom per amino acid without incurring loss of accuracy of structural representations. The suggested method finds, by construction, the optimal compromise between these needs. Several possible oligon lengths are considered. It is shown that meaningful classifications cannot be done for lengths greater than six or smaller than four. Different contexts are considered for which oligons of length five or six are recommendable. With only a few dozen oligons of such length, virtually any protein can be reproduced within typical experimental uncertainties. Structural data for the oligons are made publicly available.},

Compelling data support the investigation of numerous enzymes as therapeutic targets to exploit metabolic vulnerabilities common to several cancer types. We discuss the rationale for developing such drugs and review three targets with central roles in metabolic pathways crucial for cancer cell growth: pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme splice variant 2 ({PKM2}) in glycolysis, glutaminase in glutaminolysis, and mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 isozymes (IDH1/2) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These targets exemplify the drugging approach to cancer metabolism, with allosteric modulation being the common theme. The first glutaminase and mutant IDH1/2 inhibitors have entered clinical testing, and early data are promising. Cancer metabolism provides a wealth of novel targets, and targeting allosteric sites promises to yield selective drugs with the potential to transform clinical outcomes across many cancer types. },

Ninety percent of the known disease-causing missense mutations examined fit this model, with the vast majority affecting protein stability, through a variety of energy related factors.

	Abstract = {How the interplay between protein structure and internal dynamics regulates protein function is poorly understood. Often, ligand binding, post-translational modifications and mutations modify protein activity in a manner that is not possible to rationalize solely on the basis of structural data. It is likely that changes in the internal motions of proteins have a major role in regulating protein activity, but the nature of their contributions remains elusive, especially in quantitative terms. Here we show that changes in conformational entropy can determine whether protein-ligand interactions will occur, even among protein complexes with identical binding interfaces. We have used {NMR} spectroscopy to determine the changes in structure and internal dynamics that are elicited by the binding of {DNA} to several variants of the catabolite activator protein (CAP) that differentially populate the inactive and active {DNA}-binding domain states. We found that the CAP variants have markedly different affinities for DNA, despite the CAP−{DNA}-binding interfaces being essentially identical in the various complexes. Combined with thermodynamic data, the results show that conformational entropy changes can inhibit the binding of CAP variants that are structurally poised for optimal {DNA} binding or can stimulate the binding activity of CAP variants that only transiently populate the {DNA}-binding-domain active state. Collectively, the data show how changes in fast internal dynamics (conformational entropy) and slow internal dynamics (energetically excited conformational states) can regulate binding activity in a way that cannot be predicted on the basis of the protein's ground-state structure.},

@article{Craveur:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Protein structures are valuable tools to understand protein function. Nonetheless, proteins are often considered as rigid macromolecules while their structures exhibit specific flexibility, which is essential to complete their functions. Analyses of protein structures and dynamics are often performed with a simplified three-state description, i.e., the classical secondary structures. More precise and complete description of protein backbone conformation can be obtained using libraries of small protein fragments that are able to approximate every part of protein structures. These libraries, called structural alphabets (SAs), have been widely used in structure analysis field, from definition of ligand binding sites to superimposition of protein structures. SAs are also well suited to analyze the dynamics of protein structures. Here, we review innovative approaches that investigate protein flexibility based on SAs description. Coupled to various sources of experimental data (e.g., B-factor) and computational methodology (e.g., Molecular Dynamic simulation), SAs turn out to be powerful tools to analyze protein dynamics, e.g., to examine allosteric mechanisms in large set of structures in complexes, to identify order/disorder transition. SAs were also shown to be quite efficient to predict protein flexibility from amino-acid sequence. Finally, in this review, we exemplify the interest of SAs for studying flexibility with different cases of proteins implicated in pathologies and diseases. },

	Abstract = {Allosteric communication between two ligand-binding sites in a protein is a central aspect of biological regulation that remains mechanistically unclear. Here we show that perturbations in equilibrium picosecond-nanosecond motions impact zinc (Zn)-induced allosteric inhibition of {DNA} binding by the Zn efflux repressor CzrA (chromosomal zinc-regulated repressor). {DNA} binding leads to an unanticipated increase in methyl side-chain flexibility and thus stabilizes the complex entropically; Zn binding redistributes these motions, inhibiting formation of the {DNA} complex by restricting coupled fast motions and concerted slower motions. Allosterically impaired CzrA mutants are characterized by distinct nonnative fast internal dynamics "fingerprints" upon Zn binding, and {DNA} binding is weakly regulated. We demonstrate the predictive power of the wild-type dynamics fingerprint to identify key residues in dynamics-driven allostery. We propose that driving forces arising from dynamics can be harnessed by nature to evolve new allosteric ligand specificities in a compact molecular scaffold.},

@article{Saavedra:2018aa,
	Abstract = {Adaptation of organisms to environmental niches is a hallmark of evolution. One prevalent example is that of thermal adaptation, in which two descendants evolve at different temperature extremes1,2. Underlying the physiological differences between such organisms are changes in enzymes that catalyse essential reactions 3 , with orthologues from each organism undergoing adaptive mutations that preserve similar catalytic rates at their respective physiological temperatures4,5. The sequence changes responsible for these adaptive differences, however, are often at surface-exposed sites distant from the substrate-binding site, leaving the active site of the enzyme structurally unperturbed6,7. How such changes are allosterically propagated to the active site, to modulate activity, is not known. Here we show that entropy-tuning changes can be engineered into distal sites of Escherichia coli adenylate kinase, allowing us to quantitatively assess the role of dynamics in determining affinity, turnover and the role in driving adaptation. The results not only reveal a dynamics-based allosteric tuning mechanism, but also uncover a spatial separation of the control of key enzymatic parameters. Fluctuations in one mobile domain (the LID) control substrate affinity, whereas dynamic attenuation in the other domain (the AMP-binding domain) affects rate-limiting conformational changes that govern enzyme turnover. Dynamics-based regulation may thus represent an elegant, widespread and previously unrealized evolutionary adaptation mechanism that fine-tunes biological function without altering the ground state structure. Furthermore, because rigid-body conformational changes in both domains were thought to be rate limiting for turnover8,9, these adaptation studies reveal a new model for understanding the relationship between dynamics and turnover in adenylate kinase.},

	Abstract = {The functions of many proteins are regulated through allostery, whereby effector binding at a distal site changes the functional activity (e.g., substrate binding affinity or catalytic efficiency) at the active site. Most allosteric studies have focused on thermodynamic properties, in particular, substrate binding affinity. Changes in substrate binding affinity by allosteric effectors have generally been thought to be mediated by conformational transitions of the proteins or, alternatively, by changes in the broadness of the free energy basin of the protein conformational state without shifting the basin minimum position. When effector binding changes the free energy landscape of a protein in conformational space, the change affects not only thermodynamic properties but also dynamic properties, including the amplitudes of motions on different time scales and rates of conformational transitions. Here we assess the roles of conformational dynamics in allosteric regulation. Two cases are highlighted where {NMR} spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation have been used as complementary approaches to identify residues possibly involved in allosteric communication. Perspectives on contentious issues, for example, the relationship between picosecond-nanosecond local and microsecond-millisecond conformational exchange dynamics, are presented.},

When mixing wild-type monomers with monomers lacking the catalytic base for the dTTPase reaction, we observe that each wild-type subunit hydrolyzes dTTP independently in the absence of single-stranded DNA. Conversely, when either these catalytically inactive monomers or altered monomers incapable of binding single-stranded {DNA} are mixed with wild-type monomers, a small fraction of altered to wild-type monomers causes a sharp decline in {DNA}-dependent dTTP hydrolysis.

	Abstract = {The HerA ATPase cooperates with the NurA nuclease and the Mre11-Rad50 complex for the repair of double-strand {DNA} breaks in thermophilic archaea. Here we extend our structural knowledge of this minimal end-resection apparatus by presenting the first crystal structure of hexameric HerA. The full-length structure visualizes at atomic resolution the N-terminal HerA-ATP synthase domain and a conserved C-terminal extension, which acts as a physical brace between adjacent protomers. The brace also interacts in trans with nucleotide-binding residues of the neighbouring subunit. Our observations support a model in which the coaxial interaction of the HerA ring with the toroidal NurA dimer generates a continuous channel traversing the complex. HerA-driven translocation would propel the {DNA} towards the narrow annulus of NurA, leading to duplex melting and nucleolytic digestion. This system differs substantially from the bacterial end-resection paradigms. Our findings suggest a novel mode of {DNA}-end processing by this integrated archaeal helicase-nuclease machine. },

	Abstract = {The subunits of the presumptive replicative helicase of archaea and eukaryotes, the MCM complex, are members of the AAA+ (ATPase-associated with various cellular activities) family of ATPases. Proteins within this family harness the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to perform a broad range of cellular processes. Here, we investigate the function of the AAA+ site in the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsoMCM). We find that SsoMCM has an unusual active-site architecture, with a unique blend of features previously found only in distinct families of AAA+ proteins. We additionally describe a series of mutant doping experiments to investigate the mechanistic basis of intersubunit coordination in the generation of helicase activity. Our results indicate that MCM can tolerate catalytically inactive subunits and still function as a helicase, leading us to propose a semisequential model for helicase activity of this complex.},

@article{Gao:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 ({PKM2}) is an enzyme-catalyzing conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate in the glycolysis pathway. It was demonstrated that {PKM2} interacts with tyrosine phosphopeptide, and the interaction with the tyrosine phosphopeptide affects the pyruvate kinase activity of {PKM2}. Our experiments suggest that {PKM2} is also an active protein kinase (Gao, X., Wang, H., Yang, J. J., Liu, X., and Liu, Z. R. (2012) Mol. Cell 45, 598-609). We report here that growth signals reciprocally regulate the pyruvate kinase and protein kinase activities of {PKM2} by different mechanisms. On the one hand, growth signals induce protein tyrosine phosphorylations. The tyrosine-phosphorylated protein(s) regulates the conversion of pyruvate kinase and protein kinase of {PKM2} by directly interacting with {PKM2}. Binding of the tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins at the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-binding site converts the tetrameric {PKM2} to a dimer. On the other hand, growth stimulations also lead to {PKM2} phosphorylation, which consequently regulates the conversion of protein kinase and pyruvate kinase activities. Growth factor stimulations significantly increase the dimer/tetramer {PKM2} ratio in cells and consequently activate the protein kinase activity of {PKM2}. Our study suggests that the conversion between the pyruvate kinase and protein kinase activities of {PKM2} may be an important mechanism mediating the effects of growth signals in promoting cell proliferation.},

	Abstract = {On average, each human gene has approximately four SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the coding region, half of which are nsSNPs (non-synonymous SNPs) or missense SNPs. Current attention is focused on those that are known to perturb function and are strongly linked to disease. However, the vast majority of SNPs have not been investigated for the possibility of causing disease. We set out to assess the fraction of nsSNPs that encode proteins that have altered stability and activity, for this class of variants would be candidates to perturb cellular function. We tested the thermostability and, where possible, the catalytic activity for the most common variant (wild-type) and minor variants (total of 46 SNPs) for 16 human enzymes for which the three-dimensional structures were known. There were significant differences in the stability of almost half of the variants (48%) compared with their wild-type counterparts. The catalytic efficiency of approx. 14 variants was significantly altered, including several variants of human {PKM2} (pyruvate kinase muscle 2). Two {PKM2} variants, S437Y and E28K, also exhibited changes in their allosteric regulation compared with the wild-type enzyme. The high proportion of nsSNPs that affect protein stability and function, albeit subtly, underscores the need for experimental analysis of the diverse human proteome.},

However, despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.},

@article{Pandini:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Switching of bacterial flagellar rotation is caused by large domain movements of the FliG protein triggered by binding of the signal protein CheY to FliM. FliG and FliM form adjacent multi-subunit arrays within the basal body C-ring. The movements alter the interaction of the FliG C-terminal (FliGC) "torque" helix with the stator complexes. Atomic models based on the Salmonella entrovar C-ring electron microscopy reconstruction have implications for switching, but lack consensus on the relative locations of the FliG armadillo (ARM) domains (amino-terminal (FliGN), middle (FliGM) and FliGC) as well as changes during chemotaxis. The generality of the Salmonella model is challenged by the variation in motor morphology and response between species. We studied coevolved residue mutations to determine the unifying elements of switch architecture. Residue interactions, measured by their coevolution, were formalized as a network, guided by structural data. Our measurements reveal a common design with dedicated switch and motor modules. The FliM middle domain (FliMM) has extensive connectivity most simply explained by conserved intra and inter-subunit contacts. In contrast, FliG has patchy, complex architecture. Conserved structural motifs form interacting nodes in the coevolution network that wire FliMM to the FliGC C-terminal, four-helix motor module (C3-6). FliG C3-6 coevolution is organized around the torque helix, differently from other ARM domains. The nodes form separated, surface-proximal patches that are targeted by deleterious mutations as in other allosteric systems. The dominant node is formed by the EHPQ motif at the FliMMFliGM contact interface and adjacent helix residues at a central location within FliGM. The node interacts with nodes in the N-terminal FliGc α-helix triad (ARM-C) and FliGN. ARM-C, separated from C3-6 by the MFVF motif, has poor intra-network connectivity consistent with its variable orientation revealed by structural data. ARM-C could be the convertor element that provides mechanistic and species diversity. },

Interfacial loop immobilization by complex formation coupled elastic fluctuations of the FliM middle (FliMM) and FliG middle (FliGM) domains. Coevolved mutations captured interfacial dynamics as well as contacts. FliGM rotation was amplified via two central hinges to the FliGC helix. Intrinsic flexibility, reported by the FliGMC ensembles, reconciled conformers with opposite FliGC helix orientations. FliG domain stacking deformed the inter-domain linker and reduced flexibility; but conformational changes were not triggered by engineered linker deletions that cause a rotation-locked phenotype.

	Abstract = {Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) protein family with a role in sensing oxygen levels in the cell. Under hypoxia, the HIF-α degradation pathway is blocked and dimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) makes HIF-α transcriptionally active. Due to the common hypoxic environment of tumors, inhibition of this mechanism by destabilization of HIF-α:ARNT dimerization has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy. Following the discovery of a druggable cavity within the PAS-B domain of HIF-2α, research efforts have been directed to identify artificial ligands that can impair heterodimerization. Although the crystallographic structures of the HIF-2α:ARNT complex have elucidated the dimer architecture and the 0X3-inhibitor placement within the HIF-2α PAS-B, unveiling the inhibition mechanism requires investigation of how ligand-induced perturbations could dynamically propagate through the structure and affect dimerization. To this end, we compared evolutionary features, intrinsic dynamics and energetic properties of the dimerization interfaces of HIF-2α:ARNT in both the apo and holo forms. Residue conservation analysis highlighted inter-domain connecting elements that have a role in dimerization. Analysis of domain contributions to the dimerization energy demonstrated the importance of bHLH and PAS-A of both partners and of HIF-2α PAS-B domain in dimer stabilization. Among quaternary structure oscillations revealed by Molecular Dynamics simulations, the hinge-bending motion of the ARNT PAS-B domain around the flexible PAS-A/PAS-B linker supports a general model for ARNT dimerization in different heterodimers. Comparison of the HIF-2α:ARNT dynamics in the apo and 0X3-bound forms indicated a model of inhibition where the HIF-2α-PAS-B interfaces are destabilised as a result of water-bridged ligand-protein interactions and these local effects allosterically propagate to perturb the correlated motions of the domains and inter-domain communication. These findings will guide the design of improved inhibitors to contrast cell survival in tumor masses.},

In this article we discuss how such approaches can be combined by incorporating a wide range of different types of experimental data as restraints in computer simulations to provide unprecedented detail about the ensembles of structures that describe proteins in a wide variety of states from the native structure to highly unfolded species. Knowledge of these ensembles is beginning to enable the complete free-energy landscapes of individual proteins to be defined at atomic resolution.

	Abstract = {The concept of indirect or 'allosteric' interaction between topographically distinct sites, and the subsequent 1965 Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model for the conformational change mediating them, arose around 50 years ago. Many classic regulatory proteins (including haemoglobin, Asp transcarbamylase and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) follow the central paradigm of the MWC model, which has been expanded and challenged as a result of novel technologies. Importantly, the concept of allosteric interaction has aided our understanding of human diseases and drug design.},

@article{Freiburger:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Enzyme activity is commonly controlled by allostery, where ligand binding at one site alters the activities of distant sites. Classical explanations for multisubunit proteins involve conformational transitions that are fundamentally deterministic. For example, in the Monod-Wyman-Changeaux (MWC) paradigm, conformational transitions occur simultaneously in all subunits. In the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer (KNF) paradigm, conformational transitions only occur in ligand-bound subunits. In contrast, recent models predict conformational changes that are governed by probabilities rather than absolute rules. To better understand allostery at the molecular level, we applied a recently developed spectroscopic and calorimetric method to the interactions of a dimeric enzyme with two different ligands. We found that conformational transitions appear MWC-like for a ligand that binds at the dimer interface and KNF-like for a distal ligand. These results provide strong experimental support for probabilistic allosteric theory predictions that an enzyme can exhibit a mixture of MWC and KNF character, with the balance partly governed by subunit interface energies. },

In this review, using systems for which atomistic simulations have been carried out in our groups as examples, we describe the current understanding of allostery, how the mechanisms go beyond the classical MWC/Pauling-KNF descriptions, and point out that the "new view" of allostery, emphasizing "population shifts," is, in fact, an "old view." The presentation offers not only an up-to-date description of allostery from a theoretical/computational perspective, but also helps to resolve several outstanding issues concerning allostery.},

However, the nature of this stress remains elusive, as does the inducible anti-cancer barrier that elicits growth arrest or cell death. Here we show that in clinical specimens from different stages of human tumours of the urinary bladder, breast, lung and colon, the early precursor lesions (but not normal tissues) commonly express markers of an activated {DNA} damage response. These include phosphorylated kinases ATM and Chk2, and phosphorylated histone H2AX and p53. Similar checkpoint responses were induced in cultured cells upon expression of different oncogenes that deregulate {DNA} replication. Together with genetic analyses, including a genome-wide assessment of allelic imbalances, our data indicate that early in tumorigenesis (before genomic instability and malignant conversion), human cells activate an ATR/ATM-regulated {DNA} damage response network that delays or prevents cancer. Mutations compromising this checkpoint, including defects in the ATM-Chk2-p53 pathway, might allow cell proliferation, survival, increased genomic instability and tumour progression.},

However, cells also experience stress as a result of nutrient excess, during which reactive oxygen species (ROS) production exceeds that required for normal physiological responses. This may occur as a result of oncogene activation or chronic exposure to growth factors combined with high levels of nutrients. As a result, multiple mechanisms have evolved to allow cells to detect and adapt to elevated levels of intracellular metabolites, including promotion of signaling and proliferation by ROS, amino acid-dependent mTOR activation, and regulation of signaling and transcription through metabolite-sensitive protein modifications. We discuss how each of these responses can contribute to the development and/or progression of cancer under conditions of cellular nutrient excess and their potential roles in linking chronic organismal over-nutrition (obesity) with cancer.},

@article{Schafer:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Normal epithelial cells require matrix attachment for survival, and the ability of tumour cells to survive outside their natural extracellular matrix (ECM) niches is dependent on acquisition of anchorage independence. Although apoptosis is the most rapid mechanism for eliminating cells lacking appropriate ECM attachment, recent reports suggest that non-apoptotic death processes prevent survival when apoptosis is inhibited in matrix-deprived cells. Here we demonstrate that detachment of mammary epithelial cells from ECM causes an ATP deficiency owing to the loss of glucose transport. Overexpression of ERBB2 rescues the ATP deficiency by restoring glucose uptake through stabilization of EGFR and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) activation, and this rescue is dependent on glucose-stimulated flux through the antioxidant-generating pentose phosphate pathway. Notably, we found that the ATP deficiency could be rescued by antioxidant treatment without rescue of glucose uptake. This rescue was found to be dependent on stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, which is inhibited by detachment-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). The significance of these findings was supported by evidence of an increase in ROS in matrix-deprived cells in the luminal space of mammary acini, and the discovery that antioxidants facilitate the survival of these cells and enhance anchorage-independent colony formation. These results show both the importance of matrix attachment in regulating metabolic activity and an unanticipated mechanism for cell survival in altered matrix environments by antioxidant restoration of ATP generation.},

	Abstract = {'Reactive species' (RS) of various types are formed in vivo and many are powerful oxidizing agents, capable of damaging {DNA} and other biomolecules. Increased formation of RS can promote the development of malignancy, and the 'normal' rates of RS generation may account for the increased risk of cancer development in the aged. Indeed, knockout of various antioxidant defence enzymes raises oxidative damage levels and promotes age-related cancer development in animals. In explaining this, most attention has been paid to direct oxidative damage to {DNA} by certain RS, such as hydroxyl radical (OH*). However, increased levels of {DNA} base oxidation products such as 8OHdg (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) do not always lead to malignancy, although malignant tumours often show increased levels of {DNA} base oxidation. Hence additional actions of RS must be important, possibly their effects on p53, cell proliferation, invasiveness and metastasis. Chronic inflammation predisposes to malignancy, but the role of RS in this is likely to be complex because RS can sometimes act as anti-inflammatory agents.},

Oxidative stress can activate a variety of transcription factors including NF-κB, AP-1, p53, HIF-1α, PPAR-γ, β-catenin/Wnt, and Nrf2. Activation of these transcription factors can lead to the expression of over 500 different genes, including those for growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, cell cycle regulatory molecules, and anti-inflammatory molecules. How oxidative stress activates inflammatory pathways leading to transformation of a normal cell to tumor cell, tumor cell survival, proliferation, chemoresistance, radioresistance, invasion, angiogenesis, and stem cell survival is the focus of this review. Overall, observations to date suggest that oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and cancer are closely linked.},

	Abstract = {Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP to pyruvate and ATP in glycolysis and plays a role in regulating cell metabolism. There are four mammalian pyruvate kinase isoforms with unique tissue expression patterns and regulatory properties. The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase ({PKM2}) supports anabolic metabolism and is expressed both in cancer and normal tissue. The enzymatic activity of {PKM2} is allosterically regulated by both intracellular signaling pathways and metabolites; {PKM2} thus integrates signaling and metabolic inputs to modulate glucose metabolism according to the needs of the cell. Recent advances have increased our understanding of metabolic regulation by pyruvate kinase, raised new questions, and suggested the possibility of non-canonical {PKM2} functions to regulate gene expression and cell cycle progression via protein-protein interactions and protein kinase activity. Here we review the structure, function, and regulation of pyruvate kinase and discuss how these properties enable regulation of {PKM2} for cell proliferation and tumor growth. },

@article{Mazurek:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Cell proliferation only proceeds when metabolism is capable of providing a budget of metabolic intermediates that is adequate to ensure both energy regeneration and the synthesis of cell building blocks in sufficient amounts. In tumor cells, the glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 ({PKM2}, M2-PK) determines whether glucose is converted to lactate for regeneration of energy (active tetrameric form, Warburg effect) or used for the synthesis of cell building blocks (nearly inactive dimeric form). This review discusses the regulation mechanisms of pyruvate kinase M2 expression by different transcription factors as well as the regulation of pyruvate kinase M2 activity by direct interaction with certain oncoproteins, tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, binding of phosphotyrosine peptides, association with other glycolytic and non glycolytic enzymes, the promyelocytic leukemia tumor suppressor protein, as well as metabolic intermediates. An intervention in the regulation mechanisms of the expression, activity and tetramer to dimer ratio of pyruvate kinase M2 has severe consequences for metabolism as well as proliferation and tumorigenic capacity of the cells which makes this enzyme a promising target for potential therapeutic approaches. The quantification of the dimeric form of pyruvate kinase M2 (Tumor M2-PK) in plasma and stool allows early detection of tumors and therapy control. Several different mechanisms may induce a translocation of pyruvate kinase M2 into the nucleus. The role of pyruvate kinase M2 in the nucleus is complex as witnessed by evidence of its effect both as pro-proliferative as well as pro-apoptotic stimuli.},

@article{Vander-Heiden:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Proliferating cells adapt metabolism to support the conversion of available nutrients into biomass. How cell metabolism is regulated to balance the production of ATP, metabolite building blocks, and reducing equivalents remains uncertain. Proliferative metabolism often involves an increased rate of glycolysis. A key regulated step in glycolysis is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase to convert phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate. Surprisingly, there is strong selection for expression of the less active M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase ({PKM2}) in tumors and other proliferative tissues. Cell growth signals further decrease {PKM2} activity, and cells with less active {PKM2} use another pathway with separate regulatory properties to convert PEP to pyruvate. One consequence of using this alternative pathway is an accumulation of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) that leads to the diversion of 3PG into the serine biosynthesis pathway. In fact, in some cancers a substantial portion of the total glucose flux is directed toward serine synthesis, and genetic evidence suggests that glucose flux into this pathway can promote cell transformation. Environmental conditions can also influence the pathways that cells use to generate biomass with the source of carbon for lipid synthesis changing based on oxygen availability. Together, these findings argue that distinct metabolic phenotypes exist among proliferating cells, and both genetic and environmental factors influence how metabolism is regulated to support cell growth.},

@article{Vander-Heiden:2009aa,
	Abstract = {In contrast to normal differentiated cells, which rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy needed for cellular processes, most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed "the Warburg effect." Aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), however, and the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.},

However, the molecular targets of shikonin are not known. Here, we showed that shikonin and its analogs are inhibitors of tumor-specific pyruvate kinase-M2 ({PKM2}), among which shikonin and its enantiomeric isomer alkannin were the most potent and showed promising selectivity, that is, shikonin and alkannin at concentrations that resulted in over 50% inhibition of {PKM2} activity did not inhibit PKM1 and pyruvate kinase-L (PKL). Shikonin and alkannin significantly inhibited the glycolytic rate, as manifested by cellular lactate production and glucose consumption in drug-sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-7/Adr, MCF-7/Bcl-2, MCF-7/Bcl-x(L) and A549) that primarily express {PKM2}. HeLa cells transfected with PKM1 showed reduced sensitivity to shikonin- or alkannin-induced cell death. To the best of our knowledge, shikonin and alkannin are the most potent and specific inhibitors to {PKM2} reported so far. As {PKM2} universally expresses in cancer cells and dictates the last rate-limiting step of glycolysis vital for cancer cell proliferation and survival, enantiomeric shikonin and alkannin may have potential in future clinical application.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, a high validity correlation of the tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (Tu M2-PK) isoenzyme in comparison to standard tumor markers has been demonstrated in solid tumors. We investigated this marker in 67 patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC) in comparison to healthy controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma Tu M2-PK was measured using an ELISA assay (ScheBo Tech, Giessen, Germany) while serum CA27.29 was determined using a chemiluminescent immunoassay (Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, USA).
RESULTS: In a ROC analysis, the cut-off to discriminate patients from controls was established at 15 U/ml for Tu M2-PK (specificity 85%; positive predictive value 81%) and 30 U/ml for CA27.29 (specificity 91%; positive predictive value 92%). Median ABC baseline levels (ranges) in patients with ABC for Tu M2-PK and CA27.29 were 12.8 U/ml (4.8-252,495) and 130 U/ml (13.3-8130), respectively. Response assessment was done in 45 chemotherapy courses of 38 pts. In 13 out of 19 blocks (68.4%) with PD (progressive disease), an elevated level of Tu M2-PK at baseline or in the follow-up was found. In 17 out of 20 blocks (85%) with SD (stable disease), the Tu M2-PK level was normal at baseline or normalised within 4 weeks of treatment. All 6 patients with disease remission had a normal baseline Tu M2-PK level or the levels decreased promptly.
CONCLUSION: Tu M2-PK gives additional information about ABC, indicating disease activity and sensitivity to chemotherapy while CA27.29 reflects tumor burden.},

High expression of the {PKM2} was detected in 55.71% paraffin-embedded GBC tissue.

More than 30 different researchers accessed the challenge data. However, only four groups accepted the challenge. Features used for predictions ranged from evolutionary constraints, mutant site locations relative to active and effector binding sites, and computational docking outputs. Despite the range of expertise and strategies used by predictors, the best predictions were marginally greater than random for modified allostery resulting from mutations. In contrast, several groups successfully predicted which mutations severely reduced enzymatic activity. Nonetheless, poor predictions of allostery stands in stark contrast to the impression left by more than 700 PubMed entries identified using the identifiers "computational + allosteric."

These networks, termed sectors, are spatially organized such that active sites are linked to many surface sites distributed throughout the structure. Using the metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase as a model system, we show that: (1) the sector is strongly correlated to a network of residues undergoing millisecond conformational fluctuations associated with enzyme catalysis, and (2) sector-connected surface sites are statistically preferred locations for the emergence of allosteric control in vivo. Thus, sectors represent an evolutionarily conserved "wiring" mechanism that can enable perturbations at specific surface positions to rapidly initiate conformational control over protein function. These findings suggest that sectors enable the evolution of intermolecular communication and regulation.},

	Abstract = {Statistical analysis of protein evolution suggests a design for natural proteins in which sparse networks of coevolving amino acids (termed sectors) comprise the essence of three-dimensional structure and function. However, proteins are also subject to pressures deriving from the dynamics of the evolutionary process itself--the ability to tolerate mutation and to be adaptive to changing selection pressures. To understand the relationship of the sector architecture to these properties, we developed a high-throughput quantitative method for a comprehensive single-mutation study in which every position is substituted individually to every other amino acid. Using a PDZ domain (PSD95(pdz3)) model system, we show that sector positions are functionally sensitive to mutation, whereas non-sector positions are more tolerant to substitution. In addition, we find that adaptation to a new binding specificity initiates exclusively through variation within sector residues.

	Abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) has become an indispensable tool for investigating the architectures and dynamics of macromolecular assemblies. Here we show that covalent labeling of solvent accessible residues followed by their MS-based identification yields modeling restraints that allow mapping the location and orientation of subunits within protein assemblies. Together with complementary restraints derived from cross-linking and native MS, we built native-like models of four heterocomplexes with known subunit structures and compared them with available X-ray crystal structures. The results demonstrated that covalent labeling followed by MS markedly increased the predictive power of the integrative modeling strategy enabling more accurate protein assembly models. We applied this strategy to the F-type ATP synthase from spinach chloroplasts (cATPase) providing a structural basis for its function as a nanomotor. By subjecting the models generated by our restraint-based strategy to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we revealed the conformational states of the peripheral stalk and assigned flexible regions in the enzyme. Our strategy can readily incorporate complementary chemical labeling strategies and we anticipate that it will be applicable to many other systems providing new insights into the structure and function of protein complexes.},

Understanding how proper function is achieved at the atomic level is crucial to advancing multiple avenues of biomedical research. Biophysical studies often include X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy, providing detailed structural descriptions of these machines. However, their inherent flexibility has complicated an understanding of the relation between structure and function. Solution {NMR} spectroscopy is well suited to the study of such dynamic complexes, and continued developments have increased size boundaries; insights into function have been obtained for complexes with masses as large as 1 MDa. We highlight methyl-TROSY (transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy) {NMR}, which enables the study of such large systems, and include examples of applications to several cellular machines. We show how this emerging technique contributes to an understanding of cellular function and the role of molecular plasticity in regulating an array of biochemical activities. },

Although the initial construct reported [NADH] × [H(+)] / [NAD(+)], its pH sensitivity was eliminated by mutagenesis. The engineered biosensor Peredox reports cytosolic NADH:NAD(+) ratios and can be calibrated with exogenous lactate and pyruvate. We demonstrated its utility in several cultured and primary cell types. We found that glycolysis opposed the lactate dehydrogenase equilibrium to produce a reduced cytosolic NADH-NAD(+) redox state. We also observed different redox states in primary mouse astrocytes and neurons, consistent with hypothesized metabolic differences. Furthermore, using high-content image analysis, we monitored NADH responses to PI3K pathway inhibition in hundreds of live cells. As an NADH reporter, Peredox should enable better understanding of bioenergetics.},

	Abstract = {New promising avenues for the pharmacological treatment of skeletal and heart muscle diseases rely on direct sarcomeric modulators, which are molecules that can directly bind to sarcomeric proteins and either inhibit or enhance their activity. A recent breakthrough has been the discovery of the myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), which has been shown to increase the power output of the cardiac muscle and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. While the overall effect of OM on the mechano-chemical cycle of myosin is to increase the fraction of myosin molecules in the sarcomere that are strongly bound to actin, the molecular basis of its action is still not completely clear. We present here a Molecular Dynamics study of the motor domain of human cardiac myosin bound to OM, where the effects of the drug on the dynamical properties of the protein are investigated for the first time with atomistic resolution. We found that OM has a double effect on myosin dynamics, inducing a) an increased coupling of the motions of the converter and lever arm subdomains to the rest of the protein and b) a rewiring of the network of dynamic correlations, which produces preferential communication pathways between the OM binding site and distant functional regions. The location of the residues responsible for these effects suggests possible strategies for the future development of improved drugs and the targeting of specific cardiomyopathy-related mutations.},

@article{Pandini:2010ab,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hierarchical and partially redundant nature of protein structures justifies the definition of frequently occurring conformations of short fragments as 'states'. Collections of selected representatives for these states define Structural Alphabets, describing the most typical local conformations within protein structures. These alphabets form a bridge between the string-oriented methods of sequence analysis and the coordinate-oriented methods of protein structure analysis.
RESULTS: A Structural Alphabet has been derived by clustering all four-residue fragments of a high-resolution subset of the protein data bank and extracting the high-density states as representative conformational states. Each fragment is uniquely defined by a set of three independent angles corresponding to its degrees of freedom, capturing in simple and intuitive terms the properties of the conformational space. The fragments of the Structural Alphabet are equivalent to the conformational attractors and therefore yield a most informative encoding of proteins. Proteins can be reconstructed within the experimental uncertainty in structure determination and ensembles of structures can be encoded with accuracy and robustness.
CONCLUSIONS: The density-based Structural Alphabet provides a novel tool to describe local conformations and it is specifically suitable for application in studies of protein dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Correlated motions in biomolecules are often essential for their function, e.g., allosteric signal transduction or mechanical/thermodynamic energy transport. Because correlated motions in biomolecules remain difficult to access experimentally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are particular useful for their analysis. The established method to quantify correlations from MD simulations via calculation of the covariance matrix, however, is restricted to linear correlations and therefore misses part of the correlations in the atomic fluctuations. Herein, we propose a general statistical mechanics approach to detect and quantify any correlated motion from MD trajectories. This generalized correlation measure is contrasted with correlations obtained from covariance matrices for the B1 domain of protein G and T4 lysozyme. The new method successfully quantifies correlations and provides a valuable global overview over the functionally relevant collective motions of lysozyme. In particular, correlated motions of helix 1 together with the two main lobes of lysozyme are detected, which are not seen by the conventional covariance matrix. Overall, the established method misses more than 50% of the correlation. This failure is attributed to both, an interfering and unnecessary dependence on mutual orientations of the atomic fluctuations and, to a lesser extent, attributed to nonlinear correlations. Our generalized correlation measure overcomes these problems and, moreover, allows for an improved understanding of the conformational dynamics by separating linear and nonlinear contributions of the correlation.},

To illustrate the method we studied correlation between positional fluctuations of protons in the double-stranded self complementary oligonucleotide d(CTGAT-CAG), deduced from a 200 ps molecular dynamics simulation in the presence of explicit water molecules and counterions. It is found that on this time scale the motions of protons belonging to different residues are poorly coupled while the motion of a base proton is correlated to the motion of the sugar ring protons of the same nucleotide. Such a method may be generalized to study correlated motions of two distinct domains of a macro-molecule.},

Anharmonic effects, which are included in the molecular dynamics simulations but not in the normal analysis, are of some importance in determining the larger scale collective motions, but not the more local fluctuations.

	Abstract = {Nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and lysozyme in water are analyzed in terms of backbone atomic positional fluctuations and dynamical cross-correlations. It is found that although the molecular systems are stable, B-factors calculated over a time period as long as 500 ps are not representative for the motions within the proteins. This is especially true for the most mobile residues. On a nanosecond time-scale, the B-factors calculated from the simulations of the proteins in solution are considerably larger than those obtained by structure refinement of the proteins in crystals, based on X-ray data. The time evolution of the atomic fluctuations shows that for large portions of the proteins under study, atomic positional fluctuations are not yet converged after a nanosecond. Cross-correlations do not converge faster than the fluctuations themselves. Most display very erratic behavior if the sampling covers less than about 200 ps. It is also shown that inclusion of mobile atoms into the procedure used to remove rigid-body motion from the simulation can lead to spurious correlations between the motions of the atoms at the surface of the protein.},

	Abstract = {Allostery has come of age; the number, breadth and functional roles of documented protein allostery cases are rising quickly. Since all dynamic proteins are potentially allosteric and allostery plays crucial roles in all cellular pathways, sorting and classifying allosteric mechanisms in proteins should be extremely useful in understanding and predicting how the signals are regulated and transmitted through the dynamic multi-molecular cellular organizations. Classification organizes the complex information thereby unraveling relationships and patterns in molecular activation and repression. In signaling, current classification schemes consider classes of molecules according to their functions; for example, epinephrine and norepinephrine secreted by the central nervous system are classified as neurotransmitters. Other schemes would account for epinephrine when secreted by the adrenal medulla to be hormone-like. Yet, such classifications account for the global function of the molecule; not for the molecular mechanism of how the signal transmission initiates and how it is transmitted. Here we provide a unified view of allostery and the first classification framework. We expect that a classification scheme would assist in comprehension of allosteric mechanisms, in prediction of signaling on the molecular level, in better comprehension of pathways and regulation of the complex signals, in translating them to the cascading events, and in allosteric drug design. We further provide a range of examples illustrating mechanisms in protein allostery and their classification from the cellular functional standpoint.},

	Abstract = {Although allostery draws increasing attention, not much is known about allosteric mechanisms. Here we argue that in all proteins, allosteric signals transmit through multiple, pre-existing pathways; which pathways dominate depend on protein topologies, specific binding events, covalent modifications, and cellular (environmental) conditions. Further, perturbation events at any site on the protein surface (or in the interior) will not create new pathways but only shift the pre-existing ensemble of pathways. Drugs binding at different sites or mutational events in disease shift the ensemble toward the same conformations; however, the relative populations of the different states will change. Consequently the observed functional, conformational, and dynamic effects will be different. This is the origin of allosteric functional modulation in dynamic proteins: allostery does not necessarily need to invoke conformational rearrangements to control protein activity and pre-existing pathways are always defaulted to during allostery regardless of the stimulant and perturbation site in the protein.},

The procedure combines the strengths of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy--for obtaining experimental information at the atomic level about the structural and dynamical features of proteins--with the ability of molecular dynamics simulations to explore a wide range of protein conformations. We illustrate the method for human ubiquitin in solution and find that there is considerable conformational heterogeneity throughout the protein structure. The interior atoms of the protein are tightly packed in each individual conformation that contributes to the ensemble but their overall behaviour can be described as having a significant degree of liquid-like character. The protocol is completely general and should lead to significant advances in our ability to understand and utilize the structures of native proteins.},

	Abstract = {Protein photosensors are versatile tools for studying ligand-regulated allostery and signaling. Fundamental to these processes is the amount of energy that can be provided by a photosensor to control downstream signaling events. Such regulation is exemplified by the phototropins--plant serine/threonine kinases that are activated by blue light via conserved LOV (light, oxygen and voltage) domains. The core photosensor of oat phototropin 1 is a LOV domain that interacts in a light-dependent fashion with an adjacent alpha-helix (J alpha) to control kinase activity. We used solution {NMR} measurements to quantify the free energy of the LOV domain-J alpha-helix binding equilibrium in the dark and lit states. These data indicate that light shifts this equilibrium by approximately 3.8 kcal mol(-1), thus quantifying the energy available through LOV-J alpha for light-driven allosteric regulation. This study provides insight into the energetics of light sensing by phototropins and benchmark values for engineering photoswitchable systems based on the LOV-J alpha interaction.},

Using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation, we characterized the motions of NtrC in three functional states: unphosphorylated (inactive), phosphorylated (active), and a partially active mutant. These dynamics are indicative of exchange between inactive and active conformations. Both states are populated in unphosphorylated NtrC, and phosphorylation shifts the equilibrium toward the active species. These results support a dynamic population shift between two preexisting conformations as the underlying mechanism of activation.},

	Abstract = {Allosteric interactions are typically considered to proceed through a series of discrete changes in bonding interactions that alter the protein conformation. Here we show that allostery can be mediated exclusively by transmitted changes in protein motions. We have characterized the negatively cooperative binding of cAMP to the dimeric catabolite activator protein (CAP) at discrete conformational states. Binding of the first cAMP to one subunit of a CAP dimer has no effect on the conformation of the other subunit. The dynamics of the system, however, are modulated in a distinct way by the sequential ligand binding process, with the first cAMP partially enhancing and the second cAMP completely quenching protein motions. As a result, the second cAMP binding incurs a pronounced conformational entropic penalty that is entirely responsible for the observed cooperativity. The results provide strong support for the existence of purely dynamics-driven allostery.},

The contributions to the potentials are analyzed and compared with the potentials for the free amino acid. Although there is a large restriction in the available conformational space due to nonbonded interactions, the minimum energy positions in the protein are close to those of the free amino acid; the significance of this result is discussed. To estimate the effective barriers for rotation of the aromatic rings (tyrosine and phenylalanine), calculations are done in which the protein is permitted to relax as a function of the ring orientation. Thr resulting barriers, which are much lowere than the rigid rotation barriers, are used to evaluate the rotation rates; comparison is made with the available nuclear magnetic resonance data.},

	Abstract = {Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is increasingly employed to probe the structures of gas-phase ions, particularly those of proteins and other biological macromolecules. This process involves comparing measured mobilities to those computed for potential geometries, which requires evaluation of orientationally averaged cross sections using some approximate treatment of ion-buffer gas collisions. Two common models are the projection approximation (PA) and exact hard-spheres scattering (EHSS) that represent ions as collections of hard spheres. Though calculations for large ions and/or conformer ensembles take significant time, no algorithmic optimization had been explored. Previous EHSS programs were dominated by ion rotation operations that allow orientational averaging. We have developed two new algorithms for PA and EHSS calculations: one simplifies those operations and greatly reduces their number, and the other disposes of them altogether by propagating trajectories from a random origin. The new algorithms were tested for a representative set of seven ion geometries including diverse sizes and shapes. While the best choice depends on the geometry in a nonobvious way, the difference between the two codes is generally modest. Both are much more efficient than the existing software, for example faster than the widely used Mobcal (implementing EHSS) approximately 10-30-fold.},

	Abstract = {The structural and thermodynamic properties of a 6-residue beta-peptide that was designed to form a hairpin conformation have been studied by {NMR} spectroscopy and MD simulation in methanol solution. The predicted hairpin would be characterized by a 10-membered hydrogen-bonded turn involving residues 3 and 4, and two extended antiparallel strands. The interproton distances and backbone torsional dihedral angles derived from the {NMR} experiments at room temperature are in general terms compatible with the hairpin conformation. Two trajectories of system configurations from 100-ns molecular-dynamics simulations of the peptide in solution at 298 and 340 K have been analyzed. In both simulations reversible folding to the hairpin conformation is observed. Interestingly, there is a significant conformational overlap between the unfolded state of the peptide at each of the temperatures. As already observed in previous studies of peptide folding, the unfolded state is composed of a (relatively) small number of predominant conformers and in this case lacks any type of secondary-structure element. The trajectories provide an excellent ground for the interpretation of the {NMR}-derived data in terms of ensemble averages and distributions as opposed to single-conformation interpretations. From this perspective, a relative population of the hairpin conformation of 20% to 30% would suffice to explain the {NMR}-derived data. Surprisingly, however, the ensemble of structures from the simulation at 340 K reproduces more accurately the {NMR}-derived data than the ensemble from the simulation at 298 K, a question that needs further investigation.},

To prevent overfitting to the available data, a minimal number of new residue-specific and peptide-specific torsion terms were developed. Extensive experimental solution-phase and quantum chemical gas-phase benchmarks were used to assess the quality of the new parameters, named OPLS-AA/M, demonstrating significant improvement over previous OPLS-AA force fields. A Boltzmann weighting temperature of 2000 K was determined to be optimal for fitting the new Fourier coefficients for dihedral angle parameters. Conclusions are drawn from the results for best practices for developing new torsion parameters for protein force fields.},

	Abstract = {The Automated force field Topology Builder (ATB, http://compbio.biosci.uq.edu.au/atb ) is a Web-accessible server that can provide topologies and parameters for a wide range of molecules appropriate for use in molecular simulations, computational drug design, and X-ray refinement. The ATB has three primary functions: (1) to act as a repository for molecules that have been parametrized as part of the GROMOS family of force fields, (2) to act as a repository for pre-equilibrated systems for use as starting configurations in molecular dynamics simulations (solvent mixtures, lipid systems pre-equilibrated to adopt a specific phase, etc.), and (3) to generate force field descriptions of novel molecules compatible with the GROMOS family of force fields in a variety of formats (GROMOS, GROMACS, and CNS). Force field descriptions of novel molecules are derived using a multistep process in which results from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are combined with a knowledge-based approach to ensure compatibility (as far as possible) with a specific parameter set of the GROMOS force field. The ATB has several unique features: (1) It requires that the user stipulate the protonation and tautomeric states of the molecule. (2) The symmetry of the molecule is analyzed to ensure that equivalent atoms are assigned identical parameters. (3) Charge groups are assigned automatically. (4) Where the assignment of a given parameter is ambiguous, a range of possible alternatives is provided. The ATB also provides several validation tools to assist the user to assess the degree to which the topology generated may be appropriate for a given task. In addition to detailing the steps involved in generating a force field topology compatible with a specific GROMOS parameter set (GROMOS 53A6), the challenges involved in the automatic generation of force field parameters for atomic simulations in general are discussed. },

	Abstract = {This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz.

Recent experimental observations demonstrating that allostery can be facilitated by dynamic and intrinsically disordered proteins have resulted in a new paradigm for understanding allosteric mechanisms, which focuses on the conformational ensemble and the statistical nature of the interactions responsible for the transmission of information. Analysis of allosteric ensembles reveals a rich spectrum of regulatory strategies, as well as a framework to unify the description of allosteric mechanisms from different systems. },

@article{Bowman:2015aa,
	Abstract = {The discovery of drug-like molecules that bind pockets in proteins that are not present in crystallographic structures yet exert allosteric control over activity has generated great interest in designing pharmaceuticals that exploit allosteric effects. However, there have only been a small number of successes, so the therapeutic potential of these pockets--called hidden allosteric sites--remains unclear. One challenge for assessing their utility is that rational drug design approaches require foreknowledge of the target site, but most hidden allosteric sites are only discovered when a small molecule is found to stabilize them. We present a means of decoupling the identification of hidden allosteric sites from the discovery of drugs that bind them by drawing on new developments in Markov state modeling that provide unprecedented access to microsecond- to millisecond-timescale fluctuations of a protein's structure. Visualizing these fluctuations allows us to identify potential hidden allosteric sites, which we then test via thiol labeling experiments. Application of these methods reveals multiple hidden allosteric sites in an important antibiotic target--TEM-1 β-lactamase. This result supports the hypothesis that there are many as yet undiscovered hidden allosteric sites and suggests our methodology can identify such sites, providing a starting point for future drug design efforts. More generally, our results demonstrate the power of using Markov state models to guide experiments.},

	Abstract = {Allostery is an inherent feature of proteins, but it remains challenging to reveal the mechanisms by which allosteric signals propagate. A clearer understanding of this intrinsic circuitry would afford new opportunities to modulate protein function. Here, we have identified allosteric sites in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) by combining multiple-temperature X-ray crystallography experiments and structure determination from hundreds of individual small-molecule fragment soaks. New modeling approaches reveal 'hidden' low-occupancy conformational states for protein and ligands. Our results converge on allosteric sites that are conformationally coupled to the active-site WPD loop and are hotspots for fragment binding. Targeting one of these sites with covalently tethered molecules or mutations allosterically inhibits enzyme activity. Overall, this work demonstrates how the ensemble nature of macromolecular structure, revealed here by multitemperature crystallography, can elucidate allosteric mechanisms and open new doors for long-range control of protein function.},

	Abstract = {Pyruvate kinase M2 ({PKM2}) plays a key role in tumor metabolism and regulates the rate-limiting final step of glycolysis. In tumor cells, there are two allosteric effectors for {PKM2}: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and serine. However, the relationship between FBP and serine for allosteric regulation of {PKM2} is unknown. Here we constructed residue/residue fluctuation correlation network based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the regulation mechanism. The results suggest that the correlation network in bound {PKM2} is distinctly different from that in the free state, FBP/{PKM2}, or Ser/{PKM2}. The community network analysis indicates that the information can freely transfer from the allosteric sites of FBP and serine to the substrate site in bound {PKM2}, while there exists a bottleneck for information transfer in the network of the free state. Furthermore, the binding free energy between the substrate and {PKM2} for bound {PKM2} is significantly lower than either of FBP/{PKM2} or Ser/{PKM2}. Thus, a hypothesis of "synergistic allosteric mechanism" is proposed for the allosteric regulation of FBP and serine. This hypothesis was further confirmed by the perturbational and mutational analyses of community networks and binding free energies. Finally, two possible synergistic allosteric pathways of FBP-K433-T459-R461-A109-V71-R73-MG2-OXL and Ser-I47-C49-R73-MG2-OXL were identified based on the shortest path algorithm and were confirmed by the network perturbation analysis. Interestingly, no similar pathways could be found in the free state. The process targeting on the allosteric pathways can better regulate the glycolysis of {PKM2} and significantly inhibit the progression of tumor.},

Here, we report that SAICAR (succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribose-5'-phosphate, an intermediate of the de novo purine nucleotide synthesis pathway) specifically stimulates {PKM2}. Upon glucose starvation, cellular SAICAR concentration increased in an oscillatory manner and stimulated {PKM2} activity in cancer cells. Changes in SAICAR amounts in cancer cells altered cellular energy level, glucose uptake, and lactate production. The SAICAR-{PKM2} interaction also promoted cancer cell survival in glucose-limited conditions. SAICAR accumulation was not observed in normal adult epithelial cells or lung fibroblasts, regardless of glucose conditions. This allosteric regulation may explain how cancer cells coordinate different metabolic pathways to optimize their growth in the nutrient-limited conditions commonly observed in the tumor microenvironment.},

We developed a computational model of glycolysis and an integrated analysis using metabolic control analysis (MCA), metabolomics data, and statistical simulations. We identified and confirmed a novel mode of regulation specific to aerobic glycolysis where flux through GAPDH, the enzyme separating lower and upper glycolysis, is the rate-limiting step in the pathway and the levels of fructose (1,6) bisphosphate (FBP), are predictive of the rate and control points in glycolysis. Strikingly, negative flux control was found and confirmed for several steps thought to be rate-limiting in glycolysis. Together, these findings enumerate the biochemical determinants of the WE and suggest strategies for identifying the contexts in which agents that target glycolysis might be most effective. },

However, after analysis of the catalytic capacity of {PKM2} relative to other glycolytic enzymes, the regulation range of {PKM2} activity, metabolic flux control, and thermodynamics, we suggest that the {PKM2}-catalyzed reaction is not a rate-limiting step in cancer cell glycolysis. Hexokinase and phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), the first and third enzyme along the pathway, are rate-limiting enzymes that limit the overall glycolytic rate, whereas {PKM2} and lactate dehydrogenase, the last two enzymes in the pathway, are for the fast removal of upstream intermediates to prevent the obstruction of the pathway.

To characterize further the molecular properties of p58-M2, we overexpressed p58-M2 in Escherichia coli and purified it to homogeneity. At 22 degrees C, the monomeric p58-M2, exhibited kinase activity with an apparent Vmax of 22 +/- 9 units/mg. The Km for adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) are 3.85 +/- 2.4 and 1.55 +/- 0.73 mM, respectively. Upon activation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2), Vmax and Km for ADP and PEP were changed to 490 +/- 27 units/mg and 0.63 +/- 0.09 and 0.13 +/- 0.01 mM, respectively. These results indicated that p58-M2 has intrinsic kinase activity. Analysis of the molecular size indicated that the activation of p58-M2, by Fru-1,6-P2 resulted in the association of the monomeric p58-M2 to the tetrameric {PKM2}. p58-M2 bound to 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) (Ka = 1.7 x 10(7) M-1) and exhibited analogue specificity, whereas {PKM2} did not bind thyroid hormone. The order of binding affinity was L-T3 greater than L-thyroxine greater than 3,3',5-triiodothyropropionic acid greater than 3'-isopropyl-3,5-triiodo-L-thyronine greater than 3'5',3-triiodo-L-thyronine. Binding of T3 and its analogues resulted in the inhibition of the kinase activity of p58-M2. The order of kinase inhibitory activity and preventing its association to tetrameric {PKM2} was parallel to that of binding activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The human sequence was found to be homologous to that of rat pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) subtype M2. p58 is a monomer that has approximately 5% the enzymatic activity of the tetrameric pyruvate kinase M2. The tetrameric M2 does not bind 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). Binding of p58 to T3 and its analogs resulted in the inhibition of its pyruvate kinase activity. The apparent Ki values of T3, L-thyroxine, and D-T3 are 30 nM, 100 nM, and 2 mM, respectively. L-Thyronine and 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine had no effect. This order of activity correlates with the thermogenic effects reported for T3 and its analogs. Conversion of p58 to the tetramer is reversible and is under the control of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The conversion is inhibited by T3 in a dose-dependent manner. Since pyruvate kinase is a key enzyme in regulating cellular ADP, ATP, and pyruvate, our findings suggest that p58 may be involved in mediating some of the cellular metabolic effects induced by thyroid hormones.},

	Abstract = {Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major cause of end-stage renal disease, and therapeutic options for preventing its progression are limited. To identify novel therapeutic strategies, we studied protective factors for DN using proteomics on glomeruli from individuals with extreme duration of diabetes ({\l}50 years) without DN and those with histologic signs of DN. Enzymes in the glycolytic, sorbitol, methylglyoxal and mitochondrial pathways were elevated in individuals without DN. In particular, pyruvate kinase M2 ({PKM2}) expression and activity were upregulated. Mechanistically, we showed that hyperglycemia and diabetes decreased {PKM2} tetramer formation and activity by sulfenylation in mouse glomeruli and cultured podocytes. Pkm-knockdown immortalized mouse podocytes had higher levels of toxic glucose metabolites, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Podocyte-specific Pkm2-knockout (KO) mice with diabetes developed worse albuminuria and glomerular pathology. Conversely, we found that pharmacological activation of {PKM2} by a small-molecule {PKM2} activator, TEPP-46, reversed hyperglycemia-induced elevation in toxic glucose metabolites and mitochondrial dysfunction, partially by increasing glycolytic flux and PGC-1α mRNA in cultured podocytes. In intervention studies using DBA2/J and Nos3 (eNos) KO mouse models of diabetes, TEPP-46 treatment reversed metabolic abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction and kidney pathology. Thus, {PKM2} activation may protect against DN by increasing glucose metabolic flux, inhibiting the production of toxic glucose metabolites and inducing mitochondrial biogenesis to restore mitochondrial function.},

	Abstract = {Oncogenic signaling reprograms cancer cell metabolism to augment the production of glycolytic metabolites in favor of tumor growth. The ability of cancer cells to evade immunosurveillance and the role of metabolic regulators in T-cell functions suggest that oncogene-induced metabolic reprogramming may be linked to immune escape. EGF signaling, frequently dysregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), is also associated with increased glycolysis. Here, we demonstrated in TNBC cells that EGF signaling activates the first step in glycolysis, but impedes the last step, leading to an accumulation of metabolic intermediates in this pathway. Furthermore, we showed that one of these intermediates, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate (F1,6BP), directly binds to and enhances the activity of the EGFR, thereby increasing lactate excretion, which leads to inhibition of local cytotoxic T-cell activity. Notably, combining the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib effectively suppressed TNBC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our results illustrate how jointly targeting the EGFR/F1,6BP signaling axis may offer an immediately applicable therapeutic strategy to treat TNBC.},

	Abstract = {LPS-activated macrophages undergo a metabolic shift from dependence on mitochondria-produced ATP to reliance on aerobic glycolysis, where {PKM2} is a critical determinant. Here, we show that {PKM2} is a physiological substrate of SIRT5 and that SIRT5-regulated hypersuccinylation inhibits the pyruvate kinase activity of {PKM2} by promoting its tetramer-to-dimer transition. Moreover, a succinylation-mimetic {PKM2} K311E mutation promotes nuclear accumulation and increases protein kinase activity. Furthermore, we show that SIRT5-dependent succinylation promotes {PKM2} entry into nucleus, where a complex of {PKM2}-HIF1α is formed at the promoter of IL-1β gene in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Activation of {PKM2} using TEPP-46 attenuates Sirt5-deficiency-mediated IL-1β upregulation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Finally, we find that Sirt5-deficient mice are more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis, which is associated with Sirt5 deficiency prompted {PKM2} hypersuccinylation and boosted IL-1β production. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism by which SIRT5 suppresses the pro-inflammatory response in macrophages at least in part by regulating {PKM2} succinylation, activity, and function.},

	Abstract = {The Warburg effect, characterized by increased glucose uptake and lactate production, is a well-known universal across cancer cells and other proliferating cells. {PKM2}, a splice isoform of the pyruvate kinase (PK) specifically expressed in these cells, serves as a major regulator of this metabolic reprogramming with an adjustable activity subjected to numerous allosteric effectors and posttranslational modifications. Here, we have identified a posttranslational modification on {PKM2}, O-GlcNAcylation, which specifically targets Thr405 and Ser406, residues of the region encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 10 in cancer cells. We show that {PKM2} O-GlcNAcylation is up-regulated in various types of human tumor cells and patient tumor tissues. The modification destabilized the active tetrameric {PKM2}, reduced PK activity, and led to nuclear translocation of {PKM2}. We also observed that the modification was associated with an increased glucose consumption and lactate production and enhanced level of lipid and {DNA} synthesis, indicating that O-GlcNAcylation promotes the Warburg effect. In vivo experiments showed that blocking {PKM2} O-GlcNAcylation attenuated tumor growth. Thus, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation is a regulatory mechanism for {PKM2} in cancer cells and serves as a bridge between {PKM2} and metabolic reprogramming typical of the Warburg effect.},

	Abstract = {The kinetic and structural properties of purified, homogeneous pyruvate kinase type M2 from chicken lung and tumors, including that from Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken fibroblasts, have been compared. The "tumor enzyme" is characterized by a low affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate, pronounced serine activation, and strong alanine inhibition as compared to the "lung type". In contrast to the rat lung enzyme, which is not affected by serine, the chicken lung enzyme is slightly activated by serine. The serine metabolites phosphoserine and glycine do not activate the "tumor type M2 pyruvate kinase", but L-alpha-glycerophosphorylcholine and phosphatidylserine do slightly activate at physiological concentrations. Studies with substances structurally related to serine reveal that the hydroxyl group of serine is a prerequisite for the activation and that the amino and carboxyl groups determine the affinity of the "tumor type M2 pyruvate kinase" for serine. Two different fragmentation methods (CNBr-cleavage and V-8 proteolysis) and two different methods for separation of the resulting peptide fragments (polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focussing and SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis) indicated a high degree of homology between the type M2 pyruvate kinases from lung and tumors as well the type M1 from muscle. Each type of pyruvate kinase, however, contains one or two unique protein fragments which are characteristic for its type. We have termed those fragments L (lung), M (muscle), and T (tumor).},

	Abstract = {A comparative molecular dynamics analysis of the pyruvate kinase from Leishmania mexicana is presented in the absence and presence of the allosteric effector fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Comparisons of the simulations of the large 240 kDa apo and holo tetramers show that binding of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate cools the enzyme and reduces dynamic movement, particularly of the B-domain. The reduced dynamic movement of the holo form traps the pyruvate kinase tetramer in its enzymatically active state with the B-domain acting as a lid to cover the active site. The simulations are also consistent with a transition of the mobile active-site α6' helix, which would adopt a helical conformation in the active R-state and a less structured coil conformation in the inactive T-state. Analysis of the rigid body motions over the trajectory highlights the concerted anticorrelated rigid body rocking motion of the four protomers, which drives the T to R transition. The transitions predicted by these simulations are largely consistent with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for allosteric activation but also suggest that rigidification or cooling of the overall structure upon effector binding plays an additional role in enzyme activation. },

	Abstract = {Many studies of allosteric mechanisms use limited numbers of mutations to test whether residues play "key" roles. However, if a large percentage of the protein contributes to allosteric function, mutating any residue would have a high probability of modifying allostery. Thus, a predicted mechanism that is dependent on only a few residues could erroneously appear to be supported. We used whole-protein alanine-scanning mutagenesis to determine which amino acid sidechains of human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK; approved symbol PKLR) contribute to regulation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP; activator) and alanine (inhibitor). Each nonalanine/nonglycine residue of hL-PYK was mutated to alanine to generate 431 mutant proteins. Allosteric functions in active proteins were quantified by following substrate affinity over a concentration range of effectors. Results show that different residues contribute to the two allosteric functions. Only a small fraction of mutated residues perturbed inhibition by alanine. In contrast, a large percentage of mutated residues influenced activation by Fru-1,6-BP; inhibition by alanine is not simply the reverse of activation by Fru-1,6-BP. Moreover, the results show that Fru-1,6-BP activation would be extremely difficult to elucidate using a limited number of mutations. Additionally, this large mutational data set will be useful to train and test computational algorithms aiming to predict allosteric mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that the metabolism of some organisms, such as Escherichia coli, is remarkably efficient, producing close to the maximum amount of biomass per unit of nutrient consumed. This observation raises the question of what regulatory mechanisms enable such efficiency. Here, we propose that simple product-feedback inhibition by itself is capable of leading to such optimality. We analyze several representative metabolic modules--starting from a linear pathway and advancing to a bidirectional pathway and metabolic cycle, and finally to integration of two different nutrient inputs. In each case, our mathematical analysis shows that product-feedback inhibition is not only homeostatic but also, with appropriate feedback connections, can minimize futile cycling and optimize fluxes. However, the effectiveness of simple product-feedback inhibition comes at the cost of high levels of some metabolite pools, potentially associated with toxicity and osmotic imbalance. These large metabolite pool sizes can be restricted if feedback inhibition is ultrasensitive. Indeed, the multi-layer regulation of metabolism by control of enzyme expression, enzyme covalent modification, and allostery is expected to result in such ultrasensitive feedbacks. To experimentally test whether the qualitative predictions from our analysis of feedback inhibition apply to metabolic modules beyond linear pathways, we examine the case of nitrogen assimilation in E. coli, which involves both nutrient integration and a metabolic cycle. We find that the feedback regulation scheme suggested by our mathematical analysis closely aligns with the actual regulation of the network and is sufficient to explain much of the dynamical behavior of relevant metabolite pool sizes in nutrient-switching experiments.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we attempted to understand the mechanism of regulation of the activity and allosteric behavior of the pyruvate kinase M(2) enzyme and two of its missense mutations, H391Y and K422R, found in cells from Bloom syndrome patients, prone to develop cancer. Results show that despite the presence of mutations in the intersubunit contact domain, the K422R and H391Y mutant proteins maintained their homotetrameric structure, similar to the wild-type protein, but showed a loss of activity of 75 and 20%, respectively. Interestingly, H391Y showed a 6-fold increase in affinity for its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and behaved like a non-allosteric protein with compromised cooperative binding. However, the affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate was lost significantly in K422R. Unlike K422R, H391Y showed enhanced thermal stability, stability over a range of pH values, a lesser effect of the allosteric inhibitor Phe, and resistance toward structural alteration upon binding of the activator (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) and inhibitor (Phe). Both mutants showed a slight shift in the pH optimum from 7.4 to 7.0. Although this study signifies the importance of conserved amino acid residues in long-range communications between the subunits of multimeric proteins, the altered behavior of mutants is suggestive of their probable role in tumor-promoting growth and metabolism in Bloom syndrome patients with defective pyruvate kinase M(2).},

	Abstract = {Alternative splicing of the Pkm gene product generates the PKM1 and {PKM2} isoforms of pyruvate kinase (PK), and {PKM2} expression is closely linked to embryogenesis, tissue regeneration, and cancer. To interrogate the functional requirement for {PKM2} during development and tissue homeostasis, we generated germline {PKM2}-null mice (Pkm2(-/-)). Unexpectedly, despite being the primary isoform expressed in most wild-type adult tissues, we found that Pkm2(-/-) mice are viable and fertile. Thus, {PKM2} is not required for embryonic or postnatal development. Loss of {PKM2} leads to compensatory expression of PKM1 in the tissues that normally express {PKM2}. Strikingly, {PKM2} loss leads to spontaneous development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with high penetrance that is accompanied by progressive changes in systemic metabolism characterized by altered systemic glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and hepatic steatosis. Therefore, in addition to its role in cancer metabolism, {PKM2} plays a role in controlling systemic metabolic homeostasis and inflammation, thereby preventing HCC by a non-cell-autonomous mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic regulation influences cell proliferation. The influence of pyruvate kinase isoforms on tumor cells has been extensively studied, but whether {PKM2} is required for normal cell proliferation is unknown. We examine how {PKM2} deletion affects proliferation and metabolism in nontransformed, nonimmortalized {PKM2}-expressing primary cells. We find that deletion of {PKM2} in primary cells results in PKM1 expression and proliferation arrest. PKM1 expression, rather than {PKM2} loss, is responsible for this effect, and proliferation arrest cannot be explained by cell differentiation, senescence, death, changes in gene expression, or prevention of cell growth. Instead, PKM1 expression impairs nucleotide production and the ability to synthesize {DNA} and progress through the cell cycle. Nucleotide biosynthesis is limiting, as proliferation arrest is characterized by severe thymidine depletion, and supplying exogenous thymine rescues both nucleotide levels and cell proliferation. Thus, PKM1 expression promotes a metabolic state that is unable to support {DNA} synthesis. },

	Abstract = {Cancer cells adapt their metabolic processes to support rapid proliferation, but less is known about how cancer cells alter metabolism to promote cell survival in a poorly vascularized tumour microenvironment. Here we identify a key role for serine and glycine metabolism in the survival of brain cancer cells within the ischaemic zones of gliomas. In human glioblastoma multiforme, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) are highly expressed in the pseudopalisading cells that surround necrotic foci. We find that SHMT2 activity limits that of pyruvate kinase ({PKM2}) and reduces oxygen consumption, eliciting a metabolic state that confers a profound survival advantage to cells in poorly vascularized tumour regions. GLDC inhibition impairs cells with high SHMT2 levels as the excess glycine not metabolized by GLDC can be converted to the toxic molecules aminoacetone and methylglyoxal. Thus, SHMT2 is required for cancer cells to adapt to the tumour environment, but also renders these cells sensitive to glycine cleavage system inhibition. },

@article{Ye:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Despite the fact that most cancer cells display high glycolytic activity, cancer cells selectively express the less active M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase ({PKM2}). Here we demonstrate that {PKM2} expression makes a critical regulatory contribution to the serine synthetic pathway. In the absence of serine, an allosteric activator of {PKM2}, glycolytic efflux to lactate is significantly reduced in {PKM2}-expressing cells. This inhibition of {PKM2} results in the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates that feed into serine synthesis. As a consequence, {PKM2}-expressing cells can maintain mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activity and proliferate in serine-depleted medium, but PKM1-expressing cells cannot. Cellular detection of serine depletion depends on general control nonderepressible 2 kinase-activating transcription factor 4 (GCN2-ATF4) pathway activation and results in increased expression of enzymes required for serine synthesis from the accumulating glycolytic precursors. These findings suggest that tumor cells use serine-dependent regulation of {PKM2} and GCN2 to modulate the flux of glycolytic intermediates in support of cell proliferation.},

@article{Maddocks:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Cancer cells acquire distinct metabolic adaptations to survive stress associated with tumour growth and to satisfy the anabolic demands of proliferation. The tumour suppressor protein p53 (also known as TP53) influences a range of cellular metabolic processes, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, glutaminolysis and anti-oxidant response. In contrast to its role in promoting apoptosis during {DNA}-damaging stress, p53 can promote cell survival during metabolic stress, a function that may contribute not only to tumour suppression but also to non-cancer-associated functions of p53. Here we show that human cancer cells rapidly use exogenous serine and that serine deprivation triggered activation of the serine synthesis pathway and rapidly suppressed aerobic glycolysis, resulting in an increased flux to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Transient p53-p21 (also known as CDKN1A) activation and cell-cycle arrest promoted cell survival by efficiently channelling depleted serine stores to glutathione synthesis, thus preserving cellular anti-oxidant capacity. Cells lacking p53 failed to complete the response to serine depletion, resulting in oxidative stress, reduced viability and severely impaired proliferation. The role of p53 in supporting cancer cell proliferation under serine starvation was translated to an in vivo model, indicating that serine depletion has a potential role in the treatment of p53-deficient tumours.},

Analysis of Pkm mutant mouse lines expressing specific PKM isoforms established that PKM1 boosts tumor growth cell intrinsically. PKM1 activated glucose catabolism and stimulated autophagy/mitophagy, favoring malignancy. Importantly, we observed that pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), including small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), express PKM1, and that PKM1 expression is required for SCLC cell proliferation. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting PKM1 therapeutically in certain cancer subtypes, including pulmonary NETs.},

Despite intensive study of the contributions of individual glycolytic enzymes, systems-level analyses of flux control through glycolysis remain limited. Here, we overexpress in two mammalian cell lines the individual enzymes catalyzing each of the 12 steps linking extracellular glucose to excreted lactate, and find substantial flux control at four steps: glucose import, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and lactate export (and not at any steps of lower glycolysis). The four flux-controlling steps are specifically upregulated by the Ras oncogene: optogenetic Ras activation rapidly induces the transcription of isozymes catalyzing these four steps and enhances glycolysis. At least one isozyme catalyzing each of these four steps is consistently elevated in human tumors. Thus, in the studied contexts, flux control in glycolysis is concentrated in four key enzymatic steps. Upregulation of these steps in tumors likely underlies the Warburg effect.},

Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints.

@article{Ralser:2014aa,
	Abstract = {An {RNA} world has been placed centre stage for explaining the origin of life. Indeed, {RNA} is the most plausible molecule able to form both a (self)-replicator and to inherit information, necessities for initiating genetics. However, in parallel with self-replication, the proto-organism had to obtain the ability to catalyse supply of its chemical constituents, including the ribonucleotide metabolites required to replicate RNA. Although the possibility of an RNA-catalysed metabolic network has been considered, it is to be questioned whether {RNA} molecules, at least on their own, possess the required catalytic capacities. An alternative scenario for the origin of metabolism involves chemical reactions that are based on environmental catalysts. Recently, we described a non-enzymatic glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway-like reactions catalysed by metal ions [mainly Fe(II)] and phosphate, simple inorganic molecules abundantly found in Archaean sediments. While the {RNA} world can serve to explain the origin of genetics, the origin of the metabolic network might thus date back to constraints of environmental chemistry. Interestingly, considering a metal-catalysed origin of metabolism gives rise to an attractive hypothesis about how the first enzymes could have formed: simple {RNA} or (poly)peptide molecules could have bound the metal ions, and thus increased their solubility, concentration and accessibility. In a second step, this would have allowed substrate specificity to evolve. },

	Abstract = {The reaction sequences of central metabolism, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway provide essential precursors for nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids. However, their evolutionary origins are not yet understood. Here, we provide evidence that their structure could have been fundamentally shaped by the general chemical environments in earth's earliest oceans. We reconstructed potential scenarios for oceans of the prebiotic Archean based on the composition of early sediments. We report that the resultant reaction milieu catalyses the interconversion of metabolites that in modern organisms constitute glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The 29 observed reactions include the formation and/or interconversion of glucose, pyruvate, the nucleic acid precursor ribose-5-phosphate and the amino acid precursor erythrose-4-phosphate, antedating reactions sequences similar to that used by the metabolic pathways. Moreover, the Archean ocean mimetic increased the stability of the phosphorylated intermediates and accelerated the rate of intermediate reactions and pyruvate production. The catalytic capacity of the reconstructed ocean milieu was attributable to its metal content. The reactions were particularly sensitive to ferrous iron Fe(II), which is understood to have had high concentrations in the Archean oceans. These observations reveal that reaction sequences that constitute central carbon metabolism could have been constrained by the iron-rich oceanic environment of the early Archean. The origin of metabolism could thus date back to the prebiotic world. },

	Abstract = {Changes in allosteric regulation of glycolytic enzymes have been linked to metabolic reprogramming involved in cancer. Remarkably, allosteric mechanisms control enzyme function at significantly shorter time-scales compared to the long-term effects of metabolic reprogramming on cell proliferation. It remains unclear if and how the speed and reversibility afforded by rapid allosteric control of metabolic enzymes is important for cell proliferation. Tools that allow specific, dynamic modulation of enzymatic activities in mammalian cells would help address this question. Towards this goal, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to guide the design of m{PKM2} internal light/oxygen/voltage-sensitive domain 2 (LOV2) fusion at position D24 (PiL[D24]), an engineered pyruvate kinase M2 ({PKM2}) variant that harbours an insertion of the light-sensing LOV2 domain from Avena Sativa within a region implicated in allosteric regulation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The LOV2 photoreaction is preserved in the PiL[D24] chimera and causes secondary structure changes that are associated with a 30% decrease in the Km of the enzyme for phosphoenolpyruvate resulting in increased pyruvate kinase activity after light exposure. Importantly, this change in activity is reversible upon light withdrawal. Expression of PiL[D24] in cells leads to light-induced increase in labelling of pyruvate from glucose. PiL[D24] therefore could provide a means to modulate cellular glucose metabolism in a remote manner and paves the way for studying the importance of rapid allosteric phenomena in the regulation of metabolism and enzyme control.},

	Abstract = {Experiment and computer simulation are two complementary tools to understand the dynamics and behavior of biopolymers in solution. One particular area of interest is the ensemble of conformations populated by a particular molecule in solution. For example, what fraction of a protein sample exists in its folded conformation? How often does a particular peptide form an alpha helix versus a beta hairpin? To address these questions, it is important to determine the sensitivity of a particular experiment to changes in the distribution of molecular conformations. Consequently, a general analytic formalism is proposed to determine the sensitivity of a spectroscopic observable to the underlying distribution of conformations. A particular strength of the approach is that it provides an expression for a weighted average across conformational substates that is independent of the averaging function used. The formalism is described and applied to experimental and simulated nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) and 3J-coupling data on peptides in solution.},

Yet the allosteric mechanisms governing PYK activity in bacterial pathogens are poorly understood. Here we report biochemical, structural and metabolomic evidence that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) PYK uses AMP and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) as synergistic allosteric activators that function as a molecular "OR logic gate" to tightly regulate energy and glucose metabolism. G6P was found to bind to a previously unknown site adjacent to the canonical site for AMP. Kinetic data and structural network analysis further show that AMP and G6P work synergistically as allosteric activators. Importantly, metabolome profiling in the Mtb surrogate, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, reveals significant changes in AMP and G6P levels during nutrient deprivation, which provides insights into how a PYK OR gate would function during the stress of Mtb infection.},

In particular, the effect of changing populations of conformations, the extent of sampling, and the sampling frequency on the estimation of nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) inter-proton distances, vicinal (3)J-coupling constants, and chemical shifts are investigated. The analysis is based on 50-ns simulations of a beta-heptapeptide in methanol at 298 K, 340 K, 350 K, and 360 K. This peptide undergoes reversible folding and samples a significant proportion of the available conformational space during the simulations, with at 298 K being predominantly folded and at 360 K being predominantly unfolded. The work highlights the fact that when motional averaging is included, {NMR} data has only limited capacity to distinguish between a single fully folded peptide conformation and various mixtures of folded and unfolded conformations.

	Abstract = {We have tested the effect of all 20 proteinogenic amino acids on the activity of the M2 isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase (M2PYK) and show that, within physiologically relevant concentrations, phenylalanine, alanine, tryptophan, methionine, valine, and proline act as inhibitors, while histidine and serine act as activators. Size exclusion chromatography has been used to show that all amino acids, whether activators or inhibitors, stabilise the tetrameric form of M2PYK. In the absence of amino-acid ligands an apparent tetramer-monomer dissociation Kd is estimated to be ∼0.9 µM with a slow dissociation rate (t1/2 ∼ 15 min). X-ray structures of M2PYK complexes with alanine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan show the M2PYK locked in an inactive T-state conformation, while activators lock the M2PYK tetramer in the active R-state conformation. Amino-acid binding in the allosteric pocket triggers rigid body rotations (11$\,^{\circ}$) stabilising either T or R states. The opposing inhibitory and activating effects of the non-essential amino acids serine and alanine suggest that M2PYK could act as a rapid-response nutrient sensor to rebalance cellular metabolism. This competition at a single allosteric site between activators and inhibitors provides a novel regulatory mechanism by which M2PYK activity is finely tuned by the relative (but not absolute) concentrations of activator and inhibitor amino acids. Such 'allostatic' regulation may be important in metabolic reprogramming and influencing cell fate.},

This allows us to assess the CCS space presented by the entire structural proteome, interrogate ensembles of protein conformers, and monitor molecular dynamics trajectories.

The experimental collision cross-section (DTCCSHe) decreases from 76.6 to 73.5 nm2 upon ligand binding at pH 6.8, which correlates to the decrease in CCS calculated from crystal structures. No such changes in conformation were found at pH 9.0. Further detail on the regions that exhibit conformational change on L-histidine binding is obtained with HDX-MS experiments.

	Abstract = {The technique of ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has become of increasing interest for rapid analysis of the conformations adopted by biological macromolecules. It is currently used routinely for analysis of explosives and illegal substances in airport and military security. In biophysical research, it can be used to determine the temperature dependent rotationally averaged collision cross section of gas-phase ions of proteins and nucleic acids along with their mass to charge ratios. Nanoelectrospray ionisation allows the gentle transfer of intact biomolecules from solutions in which the native form(s) are present, into the solvent free environment of a mass spectrometer. It is believed by many researchers that the experimental collision cross sections of these molecules should have some relationship to crystal structure coordinates. In this review we outline the different experimental methods that can be used to measure ion mobility; we also describe methods used to calculate collision cross sections from input coordinates. Following this survey of the methodological approaches to IM-MS, we then summarise IM-MS data published to date for some monomeric peptides and small soluble proteins, along with collision cross sections calculated from their crystal structure coordinates. Finally we consider the relationship between experimental gas-phase conformations and those adopted in crystals and give an outlook on the application of IM-MS as a tool for structural biology.},

	Abstract = {The Warburg effect describes a pro-oncogenic metabolism switch such that cancer cells take up more glucose than normal tissue and favor incomplete oxidation of glucose even in the presence of oxygen. To better understand how tyrosine kinase signaling, which is commonly increased in tumors, regulates the Warburg effect, we performed phosphoproteomic studies. We found that oncogenic forms of fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 inhibit the pyruvate kinase M2 ({PKM2}) isoform by direct phosphorylation of {PKM2} tyrosine residue 105 (Y(105)). This inhibits the formation of active, tetrameric {PKM2} by disrupting binding of the {PKM2} cofactor fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of {PKM2} Y(105) is common in human cancers. The presence of a {PKM2} mutant in which phenylalanine is substituted for Y(105) (Y105F) in cancer cells leads to decreased cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions, increased oxidative phosphorylation with reduced lactate production, and reduced tumor growth in xenografts in nude mice. Our findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates {PKM2} to provide a metabolic advantage to tumor cells, thereby promoting tumor growth.},

	Abstract = {Human pyruvate kinase isoform M2 ({PKM2}) is a glycolytic enzyme isoform implicated in cancer. Malignant cancer cells have higher levels of dimeric {PKM2}, which is regarded as an inactive form of tetrameric pyruvate kinase. This perceived inactivity has fueled controversy about how the dimeric form of pyruvate kinase might contribute to cancer. Here we investigate enzymatic properties of {PKM2}(G415R), a variant derived from a cancer patient, which we show by size-exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering to be a dimer that cannot form a tetramer in solution. Although {PKM2}(G415R) binds to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), unlike the wild type this {PKM2} variant shows no activation by FBP. In contrast, {PKM2}(G415R) is activated by succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose 5'-phosphate (SAICAR), an endogenous metabolite that we previously showed correlates with an increased level of cell proliferation and promotes protein kinase activity of {PKM2}. Our results demonstrate an important and unexpected enzymatic activity of the {PKM2} dimer that likely has a key role in cancer progression.},

	Abstract = {Pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme mutants with amino acid substitutions in the subunit interface were prepared and characterized. The substitutions were made in the allosteric M2 isozyme by the corresponding residues of the nonallosteric M1 isozyme to identify the residue involved in the allosteric effects. The replacement of Cys-423 by Leu led to substantial loss of both homotropic and heterotropic allosteric effects while the substitutions at Phe-389, Arg-398, Ala-401, Pro-402, Thr-408, and Ile-427 did not. The altered kinetic properties of the Cys-423-substituted mutant resulted from the shift of the allosteric transition toward the active R-state since the mutant exhibits the allosteric properties in the presence of an allosteric inhibitor, L-phenylalanine. The inverse correlation between the hydrophobicity of residue 423 and the extent of stabilization of the R-state was found by analysis of mutants with un-ionizable amino acids at position 423. Furthermore, the modification of Cys-423 with methyl methanethiosulfonate led to a shift of the allosteric transition toward the R-state, probably the result of increased hydrophobicity of the residue. These results suggest that Cys-423 is involved in the allosteric regulation of the enzyme through hydrophobic interactions.},

The effect of {PKM2} concentration on its dimer-tetramer equilibrium was monitored, and a value for the dissociation constant ( Kd) of the two species was estimated to be 0.95 μM. Results of binding of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) to {PKM2} are shown and provide insight into the allosteric mechanism and changes in the oligomerization status of {PKM2}. The average Kd for binding of FBP to the {PKM2} tetramer was estimated to be 7.5 μM. It is concluded that four molecules of FBP bind to the active {PKM2} tetramer whereas binding of FBP to the {PKM2} dimer was not observed. It is suggested that either FBP potentiates rapid tetramer formation after binding to apo {PKM2} dimers or FBP binds to {PKM2} apo tetramers, thus driving the dimer-tetramer equilibrium in the direction of fully FBP-bound tetramer. The binding occurs in a highly positively cooperative manner with a Hill coefficient ( n) of 3.},

	Abstract = {An atomic resolution description of protein flexibility is essential for understanding the role that structural dynamics play in biological processes. Despite the unique dependence of nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) to motional averaging on different time scales, {NMR}-based protein structure determination often ignores the presence of dynamics, representing rapidly exchanging conformational equilibria in terms of a single static structure. In this study, we use the rich dynamic information encoded in experimental {NMR} parameters to develop a molecular and statistical mechanical characterization of the conformational behavior of proteins in solution. Critically, and in contrast to previously proposed techniques, we do not use empirical energy terms to restrain a conformational search, a procedure that can strongly perturb simulated dynamics in a nonpredictable way. Rather, we use accelerated molecular dynamic simulation to gradually increase the level of conformational sampling and to identify the appropriate level of sampling via direct comparison of unrestrained simulation with experimental data. This constraint-free approach thereby provides an atomic resolution free-energy weighted Boltzmann description of protein dynamics occurring on time scales over many orders of magnitude in the protein ubiquitin.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) access highly diverse ensembles of conformations in their functional states. Although this conformational plasticity is essential to their function, little is known about the dynamics underlying interconversion between accessible states. Nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) relaxation rates contain a wealth of information about the time scales and amplitudes of motion in IDPs, but the highly dynamic nature of IDPs complicates their interpretation. We present a novel framework in which a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used in combination with experimental (15)N relaxation measurements to characterize the ensemble of dynamic processes contributing to the observed rates. By accounting for the distinct dynamic averaging present in the different conformational states sampled by the equilibrium ensemble, we are able to accurately describe both dynamic time scales and local and global conformational sampling. The method is robust, systematically improving agreement with independent experimental relaxation data, irrespective of the actively targeted rates, and suggesting interdependence of motions occurring on time scales varying over 3 orders of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {A unique feature of chemical catalysis mediated by enzymes is that the catalytically reactive atoms are embedded within a folded protein. Although current understanding of enzyme function has been focused on the chemical reactions and static three-dimensional structures, the dynamic nature of proteins has been proposed to have a function in catalysis. The concept of conformational substates has been described; however, the challenge is to unravel the intimate linkage between protein flexibility and enzymatic function. Here we show that the intrinsic plasticity of the protein is a key characteristic of catalysis. The dynamics of the prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) in its substrate-free state and during catalysis were characterized with {NMR} relaxation experiments. The characteristic enzyme motions detected during catalysis are already present in the free enzyme with frequencies corresponding to the catalytic turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the protein motions necessary for catalysis are an intrinsic property of the enzyme and may even limit the overall turnover rate. Motion is localized not only to the active site but also to a wider dynamic network. Whereas coupled networks in proteins have been proposed previously, we experimentally measured the collective nature of motions with the use of mutant forms of CypA. We propose that the pre-existence of collective dynamics in enzymes before catalysis is a common feature of biocatalysts and that proteins have evolved under synergistic pressure between structure and dynamics.},

@article{Austin:1975aa,
	Abstract = {Myoglobin rebinding of carbon monoxide and dioxygen after photodissociation has been observed in the temperature range between 40 and 350 K. A system was constructed that records the change in optical absorption at 436 nm smoothly and without break between 2 musec and 1 ksec. Four different rebinding processes have been found. Between 40 and 160 K, a single process is observed. It is not exponential in time, but approximately given by N(t) = (1 + t/to)-n, where to and n are temperature-dependent, ligand-concentration independent, parameters. At about 170 K, a second and at 200 K, a third concentration-independent process emerge. At 210 K, a concentration-dependent process sets in. If myoglobin is embedded in a solid, only the first three can be seen, and they are all nonexponential. In a liquid glycerol-water solvent, rebinding is exponential. To interpret the data, a model is proposed in which the ligand molecule, on its way from the solvent to the binding site at the ferrous heme iron, encounters four barriers in succession. The barriers are tentatively identified with known features of myoglobin. By computer-solving the differential equation for the motion of a ligand molecule over four barriers, the rates for all important steps are obtained. The temperature dependences of the rates yield enthalpy, entropy, and free-energy changes at all barriers. The free-energy barriers at 310 K indicate how myoglobin achieves specificity and order. For carbon monoxide, the heights of these barriers increase toward the inside; carbon monoxide consequently is partially rejected at each of the four barriers. Dioxygen, in contrast, sees barriers of about equal height and moves smoothly toward the binding site. The entropy increases over the first two barriers, indicating a rupturing of bonds or displacement of residues, and then smoothly decreases, reaching a minimum at the binding site. The magnitude of the decrease over the innermost barrier implies participation of heme and/or protein. The nonexponential rebinding observed at low temperatures and in solid samples implies that the innermost barrier has a spectrum of activation energies. The shape of the spectrum has been determined; its existence can be explained by assuming the presence of many conformational states for myoglobin. In a liquid at temperatures above about 230 K, relaxation among conformational states occurs and rebinding becomes exponential.},

First, a basis set comprising a small number of assembly states is generated from extensive CG simulations. Second, a theoretical SAXS profile for each state in the basis set is computed by using the Fast-SAXS method. Finally, the relative population of the different assembly states is determined via a Bayesian-based Monte Carlo procedure seeking to optimize the theoretical scattering profiles against experimental SAXS data. The study establishes the concept of basis-set supported SAXS (BSS-SAXS) reconstruction combining computational and experimental techniques. Here, BSS-SAXS reconstruction is used to reveal the structural organization of Hck in solution and the different shifts in the equilibrium population of assembly states upon the binding of different signaling peptides.},

We fit these data to a kinetic model of glycolysis and systematically tested the consequences of 126 putative allosteric interactions on metabolite dynamics. We identified allosteric interactions that govern the reversible switch between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, including one by which pyruvate activates fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.

TRAM estimates a multiensemble Markov model (MEMM) with full thermodynamic and kinetic information at all ensembles. The approach combines the benefits of Markov state models-clustering of high-dimensional spaces and modeling of complex many-state systems-with those of the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio of exploiting biased or high-temperature ensembles to accelerate rare-event sampling. TRAM does not depend on any rate model in addition to the widely used Markov state model approximation, but uses only fundamental relations such as detailed balance and binless reweighting of configurations between ensembles. Previous methods, including the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, discrete TRAM, and Markov state models are special cases and can be derived from the TRAM equations. TRAM is demonstrated by efficiently computing MEMMs in cases where other estimators break down, including the full thermodynamics and rare-event kinetics from high-dimensional simulation data of an all-atom protein-ligand binding model.},

	Abstract = {The periplasmic oligopeptide binding protein A (OppA) represents a well-known example of water-mediated protein-ligand interactions. Here, we perform free-energy calculations for three different ligands binding to OppA, using a thermodynamic integration approach. The tripeptide ligands share a high structural similarity (all have the sequence KXK), but their experimentally-determined binding free energies differ remarkably. Thermodynamic cycles were constructed for the ligands, and simulations conducted in the bound and (freely solvated) unbound states. In the unbound state, it was observed that the difference in conformational freedom between alanine and glycine leads to a surprisingly slow convergence, despite their chemical similarity. This could be overcome by increasing the softness parameter during alchemical transformations. Discrepancies remained in the bound state however, when comparing independent simulations of the three ligands. These difficulties could be traced to a slow relaxation of the water network within the active site. Fluctuations in the number of water molecules residing in the binding cavity occur mostly on a timescale larger than the simulation time along the alchemical path. After extensive simulations, relative binding free energies that were converged to within thermal noise could be obtained, which agree well with available experimental data.},

	Abstract = {Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to construct mutants, containing one or two tryptophan residues, of the bifunctional enzyme fructose 6-phosphate,2-kinase-fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. Two of the single-tryptophan mutants (W15 and W64) had the tryptophan residue located in the kinase domain, which is in the N-terminal half, and two (W299 and W320) had the tryptophan residue located in the phosphatase domain, which is in the C-terminal half. The double-tryptophan mutants were W15/W64, W15/W299, W64/W299, and W299/W320. Dynamic polarization data indicated that these tryptophan residues had varying degrees of local mobility. Steady-state polarization data revealed energy transfer between the tryptophan residues in the double mutant W299/W320 but not in the W15/W64, W15/W299, or W64/W299 mutants, indicating the proximity of the W299 and W320 residues. The binding of fructose-6-phosphate resulted in a significant increase in the anisotropy of the W15 mutants, but did not affect the anisotropies of any of the other single-tryptophan mutants. Binding of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate also significantly increased the anisotropy of W15. In the case of fructose-6-phosphate binding, the increased anisotropy was shown to be due to a restriction of the tryptophan residue's local mobility in the presence of bound ligand, which suggests that the N-terminus is located near the kinase active site. These increases in anisotropies were used to estimate the dissociation constants of fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which were 29 +/- 3 and 2.1 +/- 0.3 microM, respectively. These observations are considered in light of the recently published crystal structure for this bifunctional enzyme.},

	Abstract = {Allostery is one of the pervasive mechanisms through which proteins in living systems carry out enzymatic activity, cell signaling, and metabolism control. Effective modeling of the protein function regulation requires a synthesis of the thermodynamic and structural views of allostery. We present here a structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery, allowing one to observe causality of communication between regulatory and functional sites, and to estimate per residue free energy changes. Based on the consideration of ligand free and ligand bound systems in the context of a harmonic model, corresponding sets of characteristic normal modes are obtained and used as inputs for an allosteric potential. This potential quantifies the mean work exerted on a residue due to the local motion of its neighbors. Subsequently, in a statistical mechanical framework the entropic contribution to allosteric free energy of a residue is directly calculated from the comparison of conformational ensembles in the ligand free and ligand bound systems. As a result, this method provides a systematic approach for analyzing the energetics of allosteric communication based on a single structure. The feasibility of the approach was tested on a variety of allosteric proteins, heterogeneous in terms of size, topology and degree of oligomerization. The allosteric free energy calculations show the diversity of ways and complexity of scenarios existing in the phenomenology of allosteric causality and communication. The presented model is a step forward in developing the computational techniques aimed at detecting allosteric sites and obtaining the discriminative power between agonistic and antagonistic effectors, which are among the major goals in allosteric drug design.},

@article{Ishwar:2015aa,
	Abstract = {In the study of allosteric proteins, understanding which effector-protein interactions contribute to allosteric activation is important both for designing allosteric drugs and for understanding allosteric mechanisms. The antihyperglycemic target, human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK), binds its allosteric activator, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP), such that the 1'-phosphate interacts with side chains of Arg501 and Trp494 and the 6'-phosphate interacts with Thr444, Thr446, Ser449 (i.e., the 444-449 loop), and Ser531. Additionally, backbone atoms from the 527-533 loop interact with a sugar ring hydroxyl and the two effector phosphate moieties. An effector analogue series indicates that only one phosphate on the sugar is required for activation. However, singly phosphorylated sugars, including Fru-1-P and Fru-6-P, bind with a Kix in the range of 0.07-1 mM. The second phosphate of Fru-1,6-BP causes tight effector binding, because this native effector has a Kix of 0.061 μM. Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate bind in the 0.07-1 mM range. The contrast with a higher Fru-1,6-BP binding indicates specificity for the fructose sugar conformation. Site-directed random mutagenesis at each residue that contacts bound Fru-1,6-BP showed that a negative charge introduced at position 531 mimics allosteric activation, even in the absence of Fru-1,6-BP. Collectively, analogue and mutagenesis studies are consistent with the 527-533 loop playing a key role in allosteric function. Deletion mutations that shortened the 527-533 loop were expected to prevent formation of hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms on the loop and Fru-1,6-BP. Indeed, Fru-1,6-BP did not activate these loop-shortened mutant proteins. Previous structural comparisons of M1-PYK and M2-PYK indicate that the 527-533 loop makes interactions across a subunit interface when an activator is not present. Mutating the hL-PYK subunit interface interactions among Trp527, Arg528, and Asp499 mimics allosteric activation. Considered with published structures, these results are consistent with (1) the two phosphates of Fru-1,6-BP docking to Arg501/Trp494 and the 444-449 loop, respectively, and (2) the formation of hydrogen bonds among Fru-1,6-BP and backbone atoms of the 527-533 loop pulling this loop away from the subunit interface, which results in breaking of the Trp527-Arg528-Asp499 interactions to elicit an allosteric response.},

	Abstract = {Many tumour cells have elevated rates of glucose uptake but reduced rates of oxidative phosphorylation. This persistence of high lactate production by tumours in the presence of oxygen, known as aerobic glycolysis, was first noted by Otto Warburg more than 75 yr ago. How tumour cells establish this altered metabolic phenotype and whether it is essential for tumorigenesis is as yet unknown. Here we show that a single switch in a splice isoform of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase is necessary for the shift in cellular metabolism to aerobic glycolysis and that this promotes tumorigenesis. Tumour cells have been shown to express exclusively the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase. Here we use short hairpin {RNA} to knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 expression in human cancer cell lines and replace it with pyruvate kinase M1. Switching pyruvate kinase expression to the M1 (adult) isoform leads to reversal of the Warburg effect, as judged by reduced lactate production and increased oxygen consumption, and this correlates with a reduced ability to form tumours in nude mouse xenografts. These results demonstrate that M2 expression is necessary for aerobic glycolysis and that this metabolic phenotype provides a selective growth advantage for tumour cells in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The pyruvate kinase M2 isoform ({PKM2}) is expressed in cancer and plays a role in regulating anabolic metabolism. To determine whether {PKM2} is required for tumor formation or growth, we generated mice with a conditional allele that abolishes {PKM2} expression without disrupting PKM1 expression. {PKM2} deletion accelerated mammary tumor formation in a Brca1-loss-driven model of breast cancer. {PKM2} null tumors displayed heterogeneous PKM1 expression, with PKM1 found in nonproliferating tumor cells and no detectable pyruvate kinase expression in proliferating cells. This suggests that {PKM2} is not necessary for tumor cell proliferation and implies that the inactive state of {PKM2} is associated with the proliferating cell population within tumors, whereas nonproliferating tumor cells require active pyruvate kinase. Consistent with these findings, variable {PKM2} expression and heterozygous {PKM2} mutations are found in human tumors. These data suggest that regulation of {PKM2} activity supports the different metabolic requirements of proliferating and nonproliferating tumor cells.},

@article{Bluemlein:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The Warburg effect describes the circumstance that tumor cells preferentially use glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. It has been reported that this metabolic reconfiguration originates from a switch in the expression of alternative splice forms (PKM1 and {PKM2}) of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK), which is also important for malignant transformation.However, analytical evidence for this assumption was still lacking. Using mass spectrometry, we performed an absolute quantification of PKM1 and {PKM2} splice isoforms in 25 human malignant cancers, 6 benign oncocytomas, tissue matched controls, and several cell lines. {PKM2} was the prominent isoform in all analyzed cancer samples and cell lines. However, this {PKM2} dominance was not a result of a change in isoform expression, since {PKM2} was also the predominant PKM isoform in matched control tissues. In unaffected kidney, lung, liver, and thyroid, {PKM2} accounted for a minimum of 93% of total PKM, for 80% - 96% of PKM in colon,and 55% - 61% of PKM in bladder. Similar results were obtained for a panel of tumor and non-transformed cell lines, where {PKM2} was the predominant form.Thus, our results reveal that an exchange in PKM1 to {PKM2} isoform expression during cancer formation is not occurring, nor do these results support conclusions that {PKM2} is specific for proliferating, and PKM1 for non-proliferating tissue.},

Such models are coarse-grained with respect to atomic models. But any modelling of processes or substances involves coarse-graining, i.e. the elimination of non-essential degrees of freedom and interactions from a more fine-grained level of modelling. The basic ingredients of developing coarse-grained models based on the properties of fine-grained models are reviewed, together with the conditions that must be satisfied in order to preserve the correct physical mechanisms in the coarse-graining process. This overview should help the reader to determine how realistic a coarse-grained model of a biomolecular system is, i.e. whether it reflects the underlying physical mechanisms or merely provides a set of pretty pictures of the process or substances of interest.},

The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.},

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

@article{Fornili:2013aa,
	Abstract = {The ability to interact with different partners is one of the most important features in proteins. Proteins that bind a large number of partners (hubs) have been often associated with intrinsic disorder. However, many examples exist of hubs with an ordered structure, and evidence of a general mechanism promoting promiscuity in ordered proteins is still elusive. An intriguing hypothesis is that promiscuous binding sites have specific dynamical properties, distinct from the rest of the interface and pre-existing in the protein isolated state. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the intrinsic dynamics of promiscuous residues in a large protein data set. Different computational methods, from coarse-grained elastic models to geometry-based sampling methods and to full-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations, were used to generate conformational ensembles for the isolated proteins. The flexibility and dynamic correlations of interface residues with a different degree of binding promiscuity were calculated and compared considering side chain and backbone motions, the latter both on a local and on a global scale. The study revealed that (a) promiscuous residues tend to be more flexible than nonpromiscuous ones, (b) this additional flexibility has a higher degree of organization, and (c) evolutionary conservation and binding promiscuity have opposite effects on intrinsic dynamics. Findings on simulated ensembles were also validated on ensembles of experimental structures extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Additionally, the low occurrence of single nucleotide polymorphisms observed for promiscuous residues indicated a tendency to preserve binding diversity at these positions. A case study on two ubiquitin-like proteins exemplifies how binding promiscuity in evolutionary related proteins can be modulated by the fine-tuning of the interface dynamics. The interplay between promiscuity and flexibility highlighted here can inspire new directions in protein-protein interaction prediction and design methods.},

	Abstract = {Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step in glycolysis and is allosterically regulated to control flux through the pathway. Two models are proposed to explain how Escherichia coli pyruvate kinase type 1 is allosterically regulated: the "domain rotation model" suggests that both the domains within the monomer and the monomers within the tetramer reorient with respect to one another; the "rigid body reorientation model" proposes only a reorientation of the monomers within the tetramer causing rigidification of the active site. To test these hypotheses and elucidate the conformational and dynamic changes that drive allostery, we performed time-resolved electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled to hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies followed by mutagenic analysis to test the activation mechanism. Global exchange experiments, supported by thermostability studies, demonstrate that fructose 1,6-bisphosphate binding to the allosteric domain causes a shift toward a globally more dynamic ensemble of conformations. Mapping deuterium exchange to peptides within the enzyme highlight site-specific regions with altered conformational dynamics, many of which increase in conformational flexibility. Based upon these and mutagenic studies, we propose an allosteric mechanism whereby the binding of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate destabilizes an α-helix that bridges the allosteric and active site domains within the monomeric unit. This destabilizes the β-strands within the (β/α)8-barrel domain and the linked active site loops that are responsible for substrate binding. Our data are consistent with the domain rotation model but inconsistent with the rigid body reorientation model given the increased flexibility at the interdomain interface, and we can for the first time explain how fructose 1,6-bisphosphate affects the active site.},

	Abstract = {The transition between the inactive T-state (apoenzyme) and active R-state (effector bound enzyme) of Trypanosoma cruzi pyruvate kinase (PYK) is accompanied by a symmetrical 8$\,^{\circ}$ rigid body rocking motion of the A- and C-domain cores in each of the four subunits, coupled with the formation of additional salt bridges across two of the four subunit interfaces. These salt bridges provide increased tetramer stability correlated with an enhanced specificity constant (k cat/S 0.5). A detailed kinetic and structural comparison between the potential drug target PYKs from the pathogenic protists T. cruzi, T. brucei and Leishmania mexicana shows that their allosteric mechanism is conserved. By contrast, a structural comparison of trypanosomatid PYKs with the evolutionarily divergent PYKs of humans and of bacteria shows that they have adopted different allosteric strategies. The underlying principle in each case is to maximize (k cat/S 0.5) by stabilizing and rigidifying the tetramer in an active R-state conformation. However, bacterial and mammalian PYKs have evolved alternative ways of locking the tetramers together. In contrast to the divergent allosteric mechanisms, the PYK active sites are highly conserved across species. Selective disruption of the varied allosteric mechanisms may therefore provide a useful approach for the design of species-specific inhibitors.},

We have obtained the first complete series of allosteric structures, in all possible ligated states, for the tetrameric enzyme, pyruvate kinase, from Leishmania mexicana. The transition between inactive T-state and active R-state is accompanied by a simple symmetrical 6 degrees rigid body rocking motion of the A- and C-domain cores in each of the four subunits. However, formation of the R-state in this way is only part of the mechanism; eight essential salt bridge locks that form across the C-C interface provide tetramer rigidity with a coupled 7-fold increase in rate.

In addition, {PKM2} activators inhibited the growth of an aggressive lung adenocarcinoma xenograft. These findings show that {PKM2} activation by small molecules influences the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and suggest that such compounds may augment cancer therapies.},

@article{Yacovan:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Cancer cells preferentially use glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for their rapid growth. They consume large amount of glucose to produce lactate even when oxygen is abundant, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. This metabolic change originates from a shift in the expression of alternative spliced isoforms of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK), from PKM1 to {PKM2}. While PKM1 is constitutively active, {PKM2} is switched from an inactive dimer form to an active tetramer form by small molecule activators. The prevalence of {PKM2} in cancer cells relative to the prevalence of PKM1 in many normal cells, suggests a therapeutic strategy whereby activation of {PKM2} may counter the abnormal cellular metabolism in cancer cells, and consequently decreased cellular proliferation. Herein we describe the discovery and optimization of a series of {PKM2} activators derived from the 2-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4] dioxin-6-yl)thio)-1-(2-methyl-1-(methylsulfonyl)indolin-5-yl) ethanone scaffold.

Here, we report the discovery of {PKM2} activators with a unique allosteric binding mode. Characterization of how these compounds impact cancer cells revealed an unanticipated link between glucose and amino acid metabolism. {PKM2} activation resulted in a metabolic rewiring of cancer cells manifested by a profound dependency on the nonessential amino acid serine for continued cell proliferation. Induction of serine auxotrophy by {PKM2} activation was accompanied by reduced carbon flow into the serine biosynthetic pathway and increased expression of high affinity serine transporters. These data support the hypothesis that {PKM2} expression confers metabolic flexibility to cancer cells that allows adaptation to nutrient stress.},

	Abstract = {The molecular structure of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, crystallized as a complex with Mn2+, K+, and pyruvate, has been solved to 2.9-A resolution. Crystals employed in the investigation belonged to the space group P1 and had unit cell dimensions a = 83.6 A, b = 109.9 A, c = 146.8 A, alpha = 94.9 degrees, beta = 93.6 degrees, and gamma = 112.3 degrees. There were two tetramers in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement, using as the search model the coordinates of the tetramer of pyruvate kinase from cat muscle [Muirhead, H., Claydon, D. A., Barford, D., Lorimer, C. G., Fothergill-Gilmore, L. A., Schiltz, E., & Schmitt, W. (1986) EMBO J.5, 475-481]. The amino acid sequence derived from the cDNA coding for the enzyme from rabbit muscle was fit to the electron density. The rabbit and cat muscle enzymes have approximately 94% sequence identity, and the folding patterns are expected to be nearly identical. There are, however, three regions where the topological models of the cat and rabbit pyruvate kinases differ. Mn2+ coordinates to the protein through the carboxylate side chains of Glu 271 and Asp 295. These two residues are strictly conserved in all known pyruvate kinases. In addition, the density for Mn2+ is connected to that of pyruvate, consistent with chelation through a carboxylate oxygen and the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate. The epsilon-NH2 of Lys 269 and the OH of Thr 327 lie on either side of the methyl group of bound pyruvate. Spherical electron density, assigned to K+, is located within a well-defined pocket of four oxygen ligands contributed by the carbonyl oxygen of Thr 113, O gamma of Ser 76, O delta 1 of Asn 74, and O delta 2 of Asp 112. The interaction of Asp 112 with the side chains of Lys 269 and Arg 72 may mediate, indirectly, monovalent cation effects on activity.},

	Abstract = {The complete nucleotide sequences of rat M1- and M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs were determined by sequencing the cDNAs and by analyses of S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension. The sequences have an identical molecular size of about 2220 nucleotides excluding a poly(A) tail and include 1593-nucleotide coding region. Their nucleotide sequences are identical except for 160-nucleotide sequences within the coding regions. The amino acid sequences of the M1- and M2-type subunits deduced from the cDNA sequences differ by only 45 residues within domain C, which constitutes the main region responsible for intersubunit contact. The sequence of this region of the M2-type shows higher homology than that of the M1-type with the corresponding sequence of the L-type. Since the M2- and L-types are allosteric enzymes, unlike to the M1-type, the residues common to the M2- and L-types, but not the M1-type may be important for mediating the allosteric properties. Genomic clones encoding both M1- and M2-type isozyme mRNAs were isolated. By partial sequence analysis of a clone lambda MPK37 four exons were identified, of which two adjacent exons coded the M1- and M2-specific sequences, respectively. The two remaining exons present downstream coded amino acids common to the two isozymes. Thus, we conclude that the M1- and M2-type isozymes of pyruvate kinase are produced from the same gene probably by alternative {RNA} splicing.},

Their sequences were compared with that of the L-type isozyme cDNA to determine the sequences of mRNA and protein of the R-type isozyme and the organizations of the L- and R-type genes. Results showed that the R-type isozyme mRNA had an identical nucleotide sequence to that of the L-type except in the 5'-terminal region including the coding sequence and the length of the 3'-untranslated region. The sequence upstream of the 5th coding residue of the L-type was replaced by a 98-nucleotide coding sequence plus a 5'-untranslated region in the R-type isozyme. Therefore, the R-type subunit consists of 574 amino acids, which is 31 residues longer than the L-type at the amino terminus. The pyruvate kinase L gene is present as a single copy per haploid genome and is composed of 12 exons and 11 introns with a length of about 9.3 kilobase pairs. The first (exon R) and second (exon L) exons encode the 5'-terminal sequences specific for the R- and L-types, respectively. The remaining downstream exons encode a sequence common to both isozymes. The last exon contains the entire 3'-untranslated region, including several putative polyadenylation signals. Alternative use of these signals is reported to be responsible for generation of multiple mRNA species for the L-type, whereas the R-type uses only the first signal. The cap site is mapped 16 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation site for the L-type, whereas multiple cap sites were suggested for the R-type. The canonical promoter of the TATA box was identified in the upstream sequence of exon L, but not in that of exon R. Instead, the 5'-flanking region of exon R contained another promoter sequence of the CAT box. Thus, we conclude that the L- and R-type isozymes of pyruvate kinase are produced from a single gene by use of different promoters.},

	Abstract = {AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a major role in regulating cellular energy balance by sensing and responding to increases in AMP/ADP concentration relative to ATP. Binding of AMP causes allosteric activation of the enzyme and binding of either AMP or ADP promotes and maintains the phosphorylation of threonine 172 within the activation loop of the kinase. AMPK has attracted widespread interest as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and, more recently, cancer. A number of direct AMPK activators have been reported as having beneficial effects in treating metabolic diseases, but there has been no structural basis for activator binding to AMPK. Here we present the crystal structure of human AMPK in complex with a small molecule activator that binds at a site between the kinase domain and the carbohydrate-binding module, stabilising the interaction between these two components. The nature of the activator-binding pocket suggests the involvement of an additional, as yet unidentified, metabolite in the physiological regulation of AMPK. Importantly, the structure offers new opportunities for the design of small molecule activators of AMPK for treatment of metabolic disorders.},

We report the discovery of a novel allosteric binding site on the nuclear receptor RORγt. Co-crystallization of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of RORγt with a series of small-molecule antagonists demonstrates occupancy of a previously unreported allosteric binding pocket. Binding at this non-canonical site induces an unprecedented conformational reorientation of helix 12 in the RORγt LBD, which blocks cofactor binding. The functional consequence of this allosteric ligand-mediated conformation is inhibition of function as evidenced by both biochemical and cellular studies. RORγt function is thus antagonized in a manner molecularly distinct from that of previously described orthosteric RORγt ligands. This brings forward an approach to target RORγt for the treatment of Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases. The elucidation of an unprecedented modality of pharmacological antagonism establishes a mechanism for modulation of nuclear receptors.},

	Abstract = {The anti-diabetic drug metformin targets pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCs), but not their differentiated progenies (non-CSCs), which may be related to distinct metabolic phenotypes. Here we conclusively demonstrate that while non-CSCs were highly glycolytic, CSCs were dependent on oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) with very limited metabolic plasticity. Thus, mitochondrial inhibition, e.g., by metformin, translated into energy crisis and apoptosis. However, resistant CSC clones eventually emerged during treatment with metformin due to their intermediate glycolytic/respiratory phenotype. Mechanistically, suppression of MYC and subsequent increase of PGC-1α were identified as key determinants for the OXPHOS dependency of CSCs, which was abolished in resistant CSC clones.

	Abstract = {Ras proteins recruit and activate effectors, including Raf, that transmit receptor-initiated signals. Monomeric Ras can bind Raf; however, activation of Raf requires its dimerization. It has been suspected that dimeric Ras may promote dimerization and activation of Raf. Here, we show that the GTP-bound catalytic domain of K-Ras4B, a highly oncogenic splice variant of the K-Ras isoform, forms stable homodimers. We observe two major dimer interfaces. The first, highly populated β-sheet dimer interface is at the Switch I and effector binding regions, overlapping the binding surfaces of Raf, PI3K, RalGDS, and additional effectors. This interface has to be inhibitory to such effectors. The second, helical interface also overlaps the binding sites of some effectors. This interface may promote activation of Raf. Our data reveal how Ras self-association can regulate effector binding and activity, and suggest that disruption of the helical dimer interface by drugs may abate Raf signaling in cancer.},

We here show that LPS induces expression of the key metabolic regulator Pyruvate Kinase M2 ({PKM2}). Activation of {PKM2} using two well-characterized small molecules, DASA-58 and TEPP-46, inhibited LPS-induced Hif-1α and IL-1β, as well as the expression of a range of other Hif-1α-dependent genes. Activation of {PKM2} attenuated an LPS-induced proinflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype while promoting traits typical of an M2 macrophage. We show that LPS-induced {PKM2} enters into a complex with Hif-1α, which can directly bind to the IL-1β promoter, an event that is inhibited by activation of {PKM2}. Both compounds inhibited LPS-induced glycolytic reprogramming and succinate production. Finally, activation of {PKM2} by TEPP-46 in vivo inhibited LPS and Salmonella typhimurium-induced IL-1β production, while boosting production of IL-10. {PKM2} is therefore a critical determinant of macrophage activation by LPS, promoting the inflammatory response.},

@article{Kumar:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Determining the three-dimensional structure of myoglobin, the first solved structure of a protein, fundamentally changed the way protein function was understood. Even more revolutionary was the information that came afterward: protein dynamics play a critical role in biological functions. Therefore, understanding conformational dynamics is crucial to obtaining a more complete picture of protein evolution. We recently analyzed the evolution of different protein families including green fluorescent proteins (GFPs), β-lactamase inhibitors, and nuclear receptors, and we observed that the alteration of conformational dynamics through allosteric regulation leads to functional changes. Moreover, proteome-wide conformational dynamics analysis of more than 100 human proteins showed that mutations occurring at rigid residue positions are more susceptible to disease than flexible residue positions. These studies suggest that disease-associated mutations may impair dynamic allosteric regulations, leading to loss of function. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the conformational dynamics of the wild-type light chain subunit of human ferritin protein along with the neutral and disease forms. We first performed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type and mutants to obtain equilibrated dynamics and then used perturbation response scanning (PRS), where we introduced a random Brownian kick to a position and computed the fluctuation response of the chain using linear response theory. Using this approach, we computed the dynamic flexibility index (DFI) for each position in the chain for the wild-type and the mutants. DFI quantifies the resilience of a position to a perturbation and provides a flexibility/rigidity measurement for a given position in the chain. The DFI analysis reveals that neutral variants and the wild-type exhibit similar flexibility profiles in which experimentally determined functionally critical sites act as hinges in controlling the overall motion. However, disease mutations alter the conformational dynamic profile, making hinges more loose (i.e., softening the hinges), thus impairing the allosterically regulated dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 ({PKM2}) converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate and plays an important role in cancer metabolism. Here, we show that post-translational modifications and a patient-derived mutation regulate pyruvate kinase activity of {PKM2} through modulating the conformation of the {PKM2} tetramer. We determined crystal structures of human {PKM2} mutants and proposed a "seesaw" model to illustrate conformational changes between an inactive T-state and an active R-state tetramers of {PKM2}. Biochemical and structural analyses demonstrate that {PKM2}(Y105E) (phosphorylation mimic of Y105) decreases pyruvate kinase activity by inhibiting FBP (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate)-induced R-state formation, and {PKM2}(K305Q) (acetylation mimic of K305) abolishes the activity by hindering tetramer formation. K422R, a patient-derived mutation of {PKM2}, favors a stable, inactive T-state tetramer because of strong intermolecular interactions. Our study reveals the mechanism for dynamic regulation of {PKM2} by post-translational modifications and a patient-derived mutation and provides a structural basis for further investigation of other modifications and mutations of {PKM2} yet to be discovered.},

The results suggest that when using a non-bonded interaction-cutoff radius of 1.4 nm a time step of maximally 10 fs should be used, in order not to produce energy sinks or wells. Using a too-large time step, e.g. 50 fs with a cutoff of 1.2 nm, as is done in the coarse-grained model of Marrink et al. (J. Phys. Chem.

Movement of the B domain was found to be essential for the catalytic reaction. Rotation of the B domain in the opening of the cleft between domains B and A induced by the binding of activating cations allows substrates to bind, whereas substrate binding shifts the rotation of the B domain in the closure of the cleft. Trp-157 accounts for the differences in tryptophan fluorescence signal with and without activating cations and substrates.

	Abstract = {Although protein expression is regulated both temporally and spatially, most proteins have an intrinsic, "typical" range of functionally effective abundance levels. These extend from a few molecules per cell for signaling proteins, to millions of molecules for structural proteins. When addressing fundamental questions related to protein evolution, translation and folding, but also in routine laboratory work, a simple rough estimate of the average wild type abundance of each detectable protein in an organism is often desirable. Here, we introduce a meta-resource dedicated to integrating information on absolute protein abundance levels; we place particular emphasis on deep coverage, consistent post-processing and comparability across different organisms. Publicly available experimental data are mapped onto a common namespace and, in the case of tandem mass spectrometry data, re-processed using a standardized spectral counting pipeline. By aggregating and averaging over the various samples, conditions and cell-types, the resulting integrated data set achieves increased coverage and a high dynamic range. We score and rank each contributing, individual data set by assessing its consistency against externally provided protein-network information, and demonstrate that our weighted integration exhibits more consistency than the data sets individually. The current PaxDb-release 2.1 (at http://pax-db.org/) presents whole-organism data as well as tissue-resolved data, and covers 85,000 proteins in 12 model organisms.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hierarchical and partially redundant nature of protein structures justifies the definition of frequently occurring conformations of short fragments as 'states'. Collections of selected representatives for these states define Structural Alphabets, describing the most typical local conformations within protein structures. These alphabets form a bridge between the string-oriented methods of sequence analysis and the coordinate-oriented methods of protein structure analysis.
RESULTS: A Structural Alphabet has been derived by clustering all four-residue fragments of a high-resolution subset of the protein data bank and extracting the high-density states as representative conformational states. Each fragment is uniquely defined by a set of three independent angles corresponding to its degrees of freedom, capturing in simple and intuitive terms the properties of the conformational space. The fragments of the Structural Alphabet are equivalent to the conformational attractors and therefore yield a most informative encoding of proteins. Proteins can be reconstructed within the experimental uncertainty in structure determination and ensembles of structures can be encoded with accuracy and robustness.
CONCLUSIONS: The density-based Structural Alphabet provides a novel tool to describe local conformations and it is specifically suitable for application in studies of protein dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Allostery offers a highly specific way to modulate protein function. Therefore, understanding this mechanism is of increasing interest for protein science and drug discovery. However, allosteric signal transmission is difficult to detect experimentally and to model because it is often mediated by local structural changes propagating along multiple pathways. To address this, we developed a method to identify communication pathways by an information-theoretical analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. Signal propagation was described as information exchange through a network of correlated local motions, modeled as transitions between canonical states of protein fragments. The method was used to describe allostery in two-component regulatory systems. In particular, the transmission from the allosteric site to the signaling surface of the receiver domain NtrC was shown to be mediated by a layer of hub residues. The location of hubs preferentially connected to the allosteric site was found in close agreement with key residues experimentally identified as involved in the signal transmission. The comparison with the networks of the homologues CheY and FixJ highlighted similarities in their dynamics. In particular, we showed that a preorganized network of fragment connections between the allosteric and functional sites exists already in the inactive state of all three proteins.},

	Abstract = {Host factor protein Cyclophilin A (CypA) regulates HIV-1 viral infectivity through direct interactions with the viral capsid, by an unknown mechanism. CypA can either promote or inhibit viral infection, depending on host cell type and HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein sequence. We have examined the role of conformational dynamics on the nanosecond to millisecond timescale in HIV-1 CA assemblies in the escape from CypA dependence, by magic-angle spinning (MAS) {NMR} and molecular dynamics (MD). Through the analysis of backbone (1)H-(15)N and (1)H-(13)C dipolar tensors and peak intensities from 3D MAS {NMR} spectra of wild-type and the A92E and G94D CypA escape mutants, we demonstrate that assembled CA is dynamic, particularly in loop regions. The CypA loop in assembled wild-type CA from two strains exhibits unprecedented mobility on the nanosecond to microsecond timescales, and the experimental {NMR} dipolar order parameters are in quantitative agreement with those calculated from MD trajectories. Remarkably, the CypA loop dynamics of wild-type CA HXB2 assembly is significantly attenuated upon CypA binding, and the dynamics profiles of the A92E and G94D CypA escape mutants closely resemble that of wild-type CA assembly in complex with CypA. These results suggest that CypA loop dynamics is a determining factor in HIV-1's escape from CypA dependence.},

	Abstract = {Calcium binding and dissociation within the cardiac thin filament (CTF) is a fundamental regulator of normal contraction and relaxation. Although the disruption of this complex, allosterically mediated process has long been implicated in human disease, the precise atomic-level mechanisms remain opaque, greatly hampering the development of novel targeted therapies. To address this question, we used a fully atomistic CTF model to test both Ca(2+)binding strength and the energy required to remove Ca(2+)from the N-lobe binding site in WT and mutant troponin complexes that have been linked to genetic cardiomyopathies. This computational approach is combined with measurements of in vitro Ca(2+)dissociation rates in fully reconstituted WT and cardiac troponin T R92L and R92W thin filaments. These human disease mutations represent known substitutions at the same residue, reside at a significant distance from the calcium binding site in cardiac troponin C, and do not affect either the binding pocket affinity or EF-hand structure of the binding domain. Both have been shown to have significantly different effects on cardiac function in vivo. We now show that these mutations independently alter the interaction between the Ca(2+)ion and cardiac troponin I subunit. This interaction is a previously unidentified mechanism, in which mutations in one protein of a complex indirectly affect a third via structural and dynamic changes in a second to yield a pathogenic change in thin filament function that results in mutation-specific disease states. We can now provide atom-level insight that is potentially highly actionable in drug design.},

An X-ray crystallographic screen was used to identify two distinct small-molecule fragments that bind to Ubc9 at a site distal to its catalytic cysteine. These fragments and related compounds inhibit SUMO conjugation in biochemical assays with potencies of 1.9-5.8 mm.

@article{Cooper:1984aa,
	Abstract = {A general model is presented whereby ligand-induced changes in protein dynamics could produce allosteric communication between distinct binding sites, even in the absence of a macromolecular conformational change. Theoretical analysis, based on the statistical thermodynamics of ligand binding, shows that cooperative interaction free energies amounting to several kJ . mol-1 may be generated by this means. The effect arises out of the possible changes in frequencies and amplitudes of macromolecular thermal fluctuations in response to ligand attachment, and can involve all forms of dynamic behaviour, ranging from highly correlated, low-frequency normal mode vibrations to random local anharmonic motions of individual atoms or groups. Dynamic allostery of this form is primarily an entropy effect, and we derive approximate expressions which might allow the magnitude of the interaction in real systems to be calculated directly from experimental observations such as changes in normal mode frequencies and mean-square atomic displacements. Long-range influence of kinetic processes at different sites might also be mediated by a similar mechanism. We suggest that proteins and other biological macromolecules may have evolved to take functional advantage not only of mean conformational states but also of the inevitable thermal fluctuations about the mean.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Pyruvate kinase muscle isoenzyme 2 ({PKM2}) is a key enzyme in aerobic glycolysis and is thought to contribute to cancer cell metabolic reprogramming. The aim of this study was to evaluate {PKM2} immunohistochemical expression as a potential prognostic biomarker in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
METHODS: A tissue microarray was constructed using surgical specimens for 115 patients who underwent resections for PDAC, stained with {PKM2} antibody, and scored for expression level. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the association between {PKM2} and patient survival, tumor stage, tumor grade, surgical margin status, lymph node ratio, perineural invasion status, or the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of tumors had positive {PKM2} expression, and 47 % of tumors had negative {PKM2} expression. {PKM2} expression was associated with overall survival (HR 0.56, p = 0.007) and CA 19-9 levels (p = 0.035), but was not associated with tumor stage, tumor grade, surgical margin status, lymph node ratio, perineural invasion, or adjuvant chemotherapy use.
CONCLUSIONS: {PKM2} expression is associated with overall survival in PDAC. Further studies are warranted to validate the value of {PKM2} as a prognostic biomarker and to examine the potential utility of {PKM2} in predicting treatment response, as well as a potential therapeutic target in PDAC.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The therapeutic and prognostic value of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase (PK) has been implicated in a variety of cancers, while their roles in treatment of and prognosis for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC) remain unclear. In this study, we determined the expression of {PKM2} in and its impact on biology and clinical outcome of human HC.
METHODS: The regulation and function of {PKM2} in HC pathogenesis was evaluated using human tissues, molecular and cell biology, and animal models, and its prognostic significance was determined according to its impact on patient survival.
RESULTS: We found that expression of hexokinase 1 and the M2 splice isoform of PK ({PKM2}) was upregulated in HC tissues and that this expression correlated with tumor recurrence and outcome. {PKM2} expression was increased in HC cases with chronic cholangitis as demonstrated by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification. High {PKM2} expression was highly correlated with high syndecan 2 (SDC2) expression and neural invasion. {PKM2} downregulation led to a decrease in SDC2 expression. Treatment with metformin markedly suppressed {PKM2} and SDC2 expression at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels and inhibited HC cell proliferation and tumor growth.
CONCLUSIONS: {PKM2} regulates neural invasion of HC cells at least in part via regulation of SDC2. Inhibition of {PKM2} and SDC2 expression contributes to the therapeutic effect of metformin on HC. Therefore, {PKM2} is an independent prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target for human HC.},

This study analyzed associations between {PKM2} expression status with various clinical and pathologic parameters in a large cohort of gallbladder cancer (GBC) patients from a long term follow up results. The expression level of pyruvate kinase isotypes in GBC tissues and their adjacent normal gallbladder tissues were estimated by qRT-PCR and Western blot. {PKM2} mRNA level were significantly high in gallbladder cancer tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.001). High expression of the {PKM2} was detected in 55.71% paraffin-embedded GBC tissue.

	Abstract = {Four isozymes of pyruvate kinase are differentially expressed in human tissue. Human pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (h{PKM2}) is expressed in early fetal tissues and is progressively replaced by the other three isozymes, M1, R, and L, immediately after birth. In most cancer cells, h{PKM2} is once again expressed to promote tumor cell proliferation. Because of its almost ubiquitous presence in cancer cells, h{PKM2} has been designated as tumor specific PK-M2, and its presence in human plasma is currently being used as a molecular marker for the diagnosis of various cancers. The X-ray structure of human h{PKM2} complexed with Mg(2+), K(+), the inhibitor oxalate, and the allosteric activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) has been determined to a resolution of 2.82 A. The active site of h{PKM2} is in a partially closed conformation most likely resulting from a ligand-induced domain closure promoted by the binding of FBP. In all four subunits of the enzyme tetramer, a conserved water molecule is observed on the 2-si face of the prospective enolate and supports the hypothesis that a proton-relay system is acting as the proton donor of the reaction (1). Significant structural differences among the human M2, rabbit muscle M1, and the human R isozymes are observed, especially in the orientation of the FBP-activating loop, which is in a closed conformation when FBP is bound. The structural differences observed between the PK isozymes could potentially be exploited as unique structural templates for the design of allosteric drugs against the disease states associated with the various PK isozymes, especially cancer and nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia.},

Crystals with either Na+ or K+ belong to the space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), and the asymmetric units contain two tetramers. The structures were solved by molecular replacement and refined to 2.1 (K+) and 2.35 A (Na+) resolution. The structures of the Na+ and K+ complexes are virtually isomorphous. Each of the eight subunits within the asymmetric unit contains MgIIoxalate as a bidentate complex linked to the protein through coordination of Mg2+ to the carboxylates of Glu 271 and Asp 295. Six of the subunits also contain an alpha,beta,gamma-tridentate complex of MgIIATP, and the active-site cleft, located between domains A and B, is closed in these subunits. In the remaining two subunits MgIIATP is missing, and the active-site cleft is open. Closure of the active-site cleft in the fully liganded subunits includes a rotation of 41 degrees of the B domain relative to the A domain. alpha-Carbons of residues in the B domain undergo movements of up to 17.8 A (Lys 124) in the cleft closure. Lys 206, Arg 119, and Asp 177 from the B domain move several angstroms from their positions in the open conformation to contact the MgIIATP complex in the active site. The gamma-phosphate of ATP coordinates to both magnesium ions and to the monovalent cation, K+ or Na+. A Mg2+-coordinated oxygen from the MgIIoxalate complex lies 3.0 A from Pgamma of ATP, and this oxygen is positioned for an in-line attack on the phosphorus. The side chains of Lys 269 and Arg 119 are positioned to provide leaving-group activation in the forward and reverse directions. There is no obvious candidate for the acid/base catalyst near the 2-si face of the prospective enolate of the normal substrate. A functional group linked through solvent and side-chain hydroxyls may function in a proton relay.},

The regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase M2 ({PKM2}) influence altered glucose metabolism in cancer. The interaction of {PKM2} with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins inhibits enzyme activity and increases the availability of glycolytic metabolites to support cell proliferation. This suggests that high pyruvate kinase activity may suppress tumor growth. We show that expression of PKM1, the pyruvate kinase isoform with high constitutive activity, or exposure to published small-molecule {PKM2} activators inhibits the growth of xenograft tumors. Structural studies reveal that small-molecule activators bind {PKM2} at the subunit interaction interface, a site that is distinct from that of the endogenous activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). However, unlike FBP, binding of activators to {PKM2} promotes a constitutively active enzyme state that is resistant to inhibition by tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. These data support the notion that small-molecule activation of {PKM2} can interfere with anabolic metabolism.},

Hyperbolic kinetics with phosphoenolpyruvate of the enzyme were found in either the presence or absence of histidine. Of a number of divalent cations tested, only Zn2+ was found to be an effective inhibitor of enzyme activity at low concentrations. The kinetic data suggested that Zn2+ acted as inhibitor as well as activator for the enzyme activity; a high affinity binding site was associated with Ki of approximately 4.8 microM Zn2+ and a catalytic site was associated with Km of approximately 80 microM Zn2+ Zn2+, which is associated to a high affinity binding site of the enzyme, was removed by the addition of histidine with a K1/2 of approximately 0.6 mM. From these findings, histidine including anserine and carnosine in muscle may act as a chelating agent for the enzyme activity.},

	Abstract = {We show that the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (M2PYK) exists in equilibrium between monomers and tetramers regulated by allosteric binding of naturally occurring small-molecule metabolites. Phenylalanine stabilizes an inactive T-state tetrameric conformer and inhibits M2PYK with an IC50 value of 0.24 mM, whereas thyroid hormone (triiodo-L-thyronine, T3) stabilizes an inactive monomeric form of M2PYK with an IC50 of 78 nM. The allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate [F16BP, AC50 (concentration that gives 50% activation) of 7 μM] shifts the equilibrium to the tetrameric active R-state, which has a similar activity to that of the constitutively fully active isoform M1PYK. Proliferation assays using HCT-116 cells showed that addition of inhibitors phenylalanine and T3 both increased cell proliferation, whereas addition of the activator F16BP reduced proliferation. F16BP abrogates the inhibitory effect of both phenylalanine and T3, highlighting a dominant role of M2PYK allosteric activation in the regulation of cancer proliferation. X-ray structures show constitutively fully active M1PYK and F16BP-bound M2PYK in an R-state conformation with a lysine at the dimer-interface acting as a peg in a hole, locking the active tetramer conformation. Binding of phenylalanine in an allosteric pocket induces a 13$\,^{\circ}$ rotation of the protomers, destroying the peg-in-hole R-state interface. This distinct T-state tetramer is stabilized by flipped out Trp/Arg side chains that stack across the dimer interface. X-ray structures and biophysical binding data of M2PYK complexes explain how, at a molecular level, fluctuations in concentrations of amino acids, thyroid hormone, and glucose metabolites switch M2PYK on and off to provide the cell with a nutrient sensing and growth signaling mechanism.},

@article{Jurica:1998aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Yeast pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the final step in glycolysis. The enzyme therefore represents an important control point and is allosterically activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). In mammals the enzyme is found as four different isozymes with different regulatory properties: two of these isozymes are produced by alternate splicing. The allosteric regulation of PK is directly related to proliferation of certain cell types, as demonstrated by the expression of an allosterically regulated isozyme in tumor cells. A model for the allosteric transition from the inactive (T) state to the active (R) state has been proposed previously, but until now the FBP-binding site had not been identified.
RESULTS: We report here the structures of PK from yeast complexed with a substrate analog and catalytic metal ions in the presence and absence of bound FBP. The allosteric site is located 40 A from the active site and is entirely located in the enzyme regulatory (C) domain. A phosphate-binding site for the allosteric activator is created by residues encoded by a region of the gene corresponding to the alternately spliced exon of mammalian isozymes. FBP activation appears to induce several conformational changes among active-site sidechains through a mechanism that is most likely to involve significant domain motions, as previously hypothesized.
CONCLUSIONS: The structure and location of the allosteric activator site agrees with the pattern of alternate genetic splicing of the PK gene in multicellular eukaryotes that distinguishes between a non-regulated isozyme and the regulated fetal isozymes. The conformational differences observed between the active sites of inactive and fully active PK enzymes is in agreement with the recently determined thermodynamic mechanism of allosteric activation through a 'metal relay' that increases the affinity of the enzyme for its natural phosphoenolpyruvate substrate.},

We show that, in human lung cancer cells, acute increases in intracellular concentrations of ROS caused inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 ({PKM2}) through oxidation of Cys(358). This inhibition of {PKM2} is required to divert glucose flux into the pentose phosphate pathway and thereby generate sufficient reducing potential for detoxification of ROS. Lung cancer cells in which endogenous {PKM2} was replaced with the Cys(358) to Ser(358) oxidation-resistant mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and impaired tumor formation in a xenograft model.

	Abstract = {Growth factors stimulate cells to take up excess nutrients and to use them for anabolic processes. The biochemical mechanism by which this is accomplished is not fully understood but it is initiated by phosphorylation of signalling proteins on tyrosine residues. Using a novel proteomic screen for phosphotyrosine-binding proteins, we have made the observation that an enzyme involved in glycolysis, the human M2 (fetal) isoform of pyruvate kinase ({PKM2}), binds directly and selectively to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. We show that binding of phosphotyrosine peptides to {PKM2} results in release of the allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, leading to inhibition of {PKM2} enzymatic activity. We also provide evidence that this regulation of {PKM2} by phosphotyrosine signalling diverts glucose metabolites from energy production to anabolic processes when cells are stimulated by certain growth factors. Collectively, our results indicate that expression of this phosphotyrosine-binding form of pyruvate kinase is critical for rapid growth in cancer cells.},

	Abstract = {During a complete cell cycle of rat thymocytes stimulated by concanavalin A and interleukin 2, the activity and mRNA level of pyruvate kinase reached a maximum (8-12-fold increase) 48 h after stimulation coinciding with the S-phase of the cell cycle. Increases of cellular enzyme activity, pyruvate kinase protein, and mRNA levels are correlated up to 48 h of culture. Afterwards pyruvate kinase activity and mRNA levels decrease, whereas the pyruvate kinase protein continues to increase throughout mitosis. This change of specific pyruvate kinase activity points to a posttranslational modification of the enzyme besides its transcriptional regulation. The presence of the M2-type isozyme was determined by the following methods: (a) native cellulose acetate electrophoresis and activity staining, (b) Northern blot hybridization with M1- and M2-specific cDNA probes, and (c) determination of kinetic parameters. The isozyme pattern did not change during the cell cycle progression. The induction of pyruvate kinase is completely abolished by 2-difluoromethylornithine-mediated polyamine depletion. However, the proportion of hybridizable pyruvate kinase mRNA was not affected. These data suggest the requirement of polyamines for efficient translation rather than transcription during cell growth.},

We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kappaBeta pathway.

	Abstract = {MCL-1 is an antiapoptotic BCL-2 family protein that has emerged as a major pathogenic factor in human cancer. Like BCL-2, MCL-1 bears a surface groove whose function is to sequester the BH3 killer domains of proapoptotic BCL-2 family members, a mechanism harnessed by cancer cells to establish formidable apoptotic blockades. Although drugging the BH3-binding groove has been achieved for BCL-2, translating this approach to MCL-1 has been challenging. Here, we report an alternative mechanism for MCL-1 inhibition by small-molecule covalent modification of C286 at a new interaction site distant from the BH3-binding groove. Our structure-function analyses revealed that the BH3 binding capacity of MCL-1 and its suppression of BAX are impaired by molecular engagement, a phenomenon recapitulated by C286W mutagenic mimicry in vitro and in mouse cells. Thus, we characterize an allosteric mechanism for disrupting the antiapoptotic BH3 binding activity of MCL-1, informing a new strategy for disarming MCL-1 in cancer.},

	Abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are approved treatments for non-small cell lung cancers harbouring activating mutations in the EGFR kinase, but resistance arises rapidly, most frequently owing to the secondary T790M mutation within the ATP site of the receptor. Recently developed mutant-selective irreversible inhibitors are highly active against the T790M mutant, but their efficacy can be compromised by acquired mutation of C797, the cysteine residue with which they form a key covalent bond. All current EGFR TKIs target the ATP-site of the kinase, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents with alternative mechanisms of action. Here we describe the rational discovery of EAI045, an allosteric inhibitor that targets selected drug-resistant EGFR mutants but spares the wild-type receptor. The crystal structure shows that the compound binds an allosteric site created by the displacement of the regulatory C-helix in an inactive conformation of the kinase. The compound inhibits L858R/T790M-mutant EGFR with low-nanomolar potency in biochemical assays. However, as a single agent it is not effective in blocking EGFR-driven proliferation in cells owing to differential potency on the two subunits of the dimeric receptor, which interact in an asymmetric manner in the active state. We observe marked synergy of EAI045 with cetuximab, an antibody therapeutic that blocks EGFR dimerization, rendering the kinase uniformly susceptible to the allosteric agent. EAI045 in combination with cetuximab is effective in mouse models of lung cancer driven by EGFR(L858R/T790M) and by EGFR(L858R/T790M/C797S), a mutant that is resistant to all currently available EGFR TKIs. More generally, our findings illustrate the utility of purposefully targeting allosteric sites to obtain mutant-selective inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous, uncontrolled studies have suggested that first-line treatment with gefitinib would be efficacious in selected patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
METHODS: In this phase 3, open-label study, we randomly assigned previously untreated patients in East Asia who had advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma and who were nonsmokers or former light smokers to receive gefitinib (250 mg per day) (609 patients) or carboplatin (at a dose calculated to produce an area under the curve of 5 or 6 mg per milliliter per minute) plus paclitaxel (200 mg per square meter of body-surface area) (608 patients). The primary end point was progression-free survival.
RESULTS: The 12-month rates of progression-free survival were 24.9% with gefitinib and 6.7% with carboplatin-paclitaxel. The study met its primary objective of showing the noninferiority of gefitinib and also showed its superiority, as compared with carboplatin-paclitaxel, with respect to progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001). In the subgroup of 261 patients who were positive for the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutation, progression-free survival was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib than among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.64; P<0.001), whereas in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the mutation, progression-free survival was significantly longer among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death with gefitinib, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05 to 3.98; P<0.001). The most common adverse events were rash or acne (in 66.2% of patients) and diarrhea (46.6%) in the gefitinib group and neurotoxic effects (69.9%), neutropenia (67.1%), and alopecia (58.4%) in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group.
CONCLUSIONS: Gefitinib is superior to carboplatin-paclitaxel as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers or former light smokers in East Asia. The presence in the tumor of a mutation of the EGFR gene is a strong predictor of a better outcome with gefitinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00322452.)},

	Abstract = {Genetic mutations in tumor cells cause several unique metabolic phenotypes that are critical for cancer cell proliferation. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induce oncogenic addiction in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). However, the linkage between oncogenic mutated EGFR and cancer cell metabolism has not yet been clearly elucidated. Here we show that EGFR signaling plays an important role in aerobic glycolysis in EGFR-mutated LAD cells. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) decreased lactate production, glucose consumption, and the glucose-induced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), indicating that EGFR signaling maintained aerobic glycolysis in LAD cells. Metabolomic analysis revealed that metabolites in the glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), pyrimidine biosynthesis, and redox metabolism were significantly decreased after treatment of LAD cells with EGFRTKI. On a molecular basis, the glucose transport carried out by glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) was downregulated in TKI-sensitive LAD cells. Moreover, EGFR signaling activated carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD), which catalyzes the first step in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. We conclude that EGFR signaling regulates the global metabolic pathway in EGFR-mutated LAD cells. Our data provide evidence that may link therapeutic response to the regulation of metabolism, which is an attractive target for the development of more effective targeted therapies to treat patients with EGFR-mutated LAD.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: ConSeq is a web server for the identification of biologically important residues in protein sequences. Functionally important residues that take part, e.g. in ligand binding and protein-protein interactions, are often evolutionarily conserved and are most likely to be solvent-accessible, whereas conserved residues within the protein core most probably have an important structural role in maintaining the protein's fold. Thus, estimated evolutionary rates, as well as relative solvent accessibility predictions, are assigned to each amino acid in the sequence; both are subsequently used to indicate residues that have potential structural or functional importance.
AVAILABILITY: The ConSeq web server is available at http://conseq.bioinfo.tau.ac.il/
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The ConSeq methodology, a description of its performance in a set of five well-documented proteins, a comparison to other methods, and the outcome of its application to a set of 111 proteins of unknown function, are presented at http://conseq.bioinfo.tau.ac.il/ under 'OVERVIEW', 'VALIDATION', 'COMPARISON' and 'PREDICTIONS', respectively.},

	Abstract = {Control of enzyme allosteric regulation is required to drive metabolic flux toward desired levels. Although the three-dimensional (3D) structures of many enzyme-ligand complexes are available, it is still difficult to rationally engineer an allosterically regulatable enzyme without decreasing its catalytic activity. Here, we describe an effective strategy to deregulate the allosteric inhibition of enzymes based on the molecular evolution and physicochemical characteristics of allosteric ligand-binding sites. We found that allosteric sites are evolutionarily variable and comprised of more hydrophobic residues than catalytic sites. We applied our findings to design mutations in selected target residues that deregulate the allosteric activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). Specifically, charged amino acids at less conserved positions were substituted with hydrophobic or neutral amino acids with similar sizes. The engineered proteins successfully diminished the allosteric inhibition of E. coli FBPase without affecting its catalytic efficiency. We expect that our method will aid the rational design of enzyme allosteric regulation strategies and facilitate the control of metabolic flux.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accessible surface area is a parameter that is widely used in analyses of protein structure and stability. Accessible surface area does not, however, distinguish between atoms just below the protein surface and those in the core of the protein. In order to differentiate between such buried residues we describe a computational procedure for calculating the depth of a residue from the protein surface.
RESULTS: Residue depth correlates significantly better than accessibility with effects of mutations on protein stability and on protein-protein interactions. The deepest residues in the native state invariably undergo hydrogen exchange by global unfolding of the protein and are often significantly protected in the corresponding molten-globule states.
CONCLUSIONS: Depth is often a more useful gage of residue burial than accessibility. This is probably related to the fact that the protein interior and surrounding solvent differ significantly in polarity and packing density. Hence, the strengths of van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between residues in a protein might be expected to depend on the distance of the residue(s) from the protein surface.},

	Abstract = {Allostery is the most efficient means of regulating protein functions, ranging from the control of metabolic mechanisms to signal transduction pathways. Although allosteric regulation has been recognized for half a century, our knowledge is limited to the characteristics of allosteric proteins and the structural coupling of allosteric sites and modulators. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of allosteric proteins that provides insight into the foundation of allosteric interactions by revealing a series of common features in the allosteric proteins. Allosteric proteins mainly appear in transferases, and phosphorylation is the most common type of modification found in allosteric proteins. Disorders related to allosteric proteins primarily comprise metabolic diseases and cancers. In general, allosteric proteins prefer to exist as monomers or even-numbered multimers. Greater stability and hydrophobicity are observed in allosteric proteins than in general proteins. Further analysis of the allosteric sites reveals a series of buried and compact pockets composed of significantly greater hydrophobic surface area than the corresponding orthosteric sites. The hydrophobicity of the allosteric sites plays a dominant role in the binding of allosteric modulators as observed in the analysis of 106 diverse allosteric protein-modulator pairs. These results may be of great significance in predicting which proteins are allosteric and in designing novel triggers to inhibit or activate proteins of interest.},

	Abstract = {Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), the 'gatekeeper' of glycolysis, catalyses the committed step of the glycolytic pathway by converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Allosteric activation and inhibition of PFK1 by over ten metabolites and in response to hormonal signalling fine-tune glycolytic flux to meet energy requirements. Mutations inhibiting PFK1 activity cause glycogen storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease, and mice deficient in muscle PFK1 have decreased fat stores. Additionally, PFK1 is proposed to have important roles in metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Despite its critical role in glucose flux, the biologically relevant crystal structure of the mammalian PFK1 tetramer has not been determined. Here we report the first structures of the mammalian PFK1 tetramer, for the human platelet isoform (PFKP), in complex with ATP-Mg(2+) and ADP at 3.1 and 3.4 {\AA}, respectively. The structures reveal substantial conformational changes in the enzyme upon nucleotide hydrolysis as well as a unique tetramer interface. Mutations of residues in this interface can affect tetramer formation, enzyme catalysis and regulation, indicating the functional importance of the tetramer. With altered glycolytic flux being a hallmark of cancers, these new structures allow a molecular understanding of the functional consequences of somatic PFK1 mutations identified in human cancers. We characterize three of these mutations and show they have distinct effects on allosteric regulation of PFKP activity and lactate production. The PFKP structural blueprint for somatic mutations as well as the catalytic site can guide therapeutic targeting of PFK1 activity to control dysregulated glycolysis in disease.},

@article{Yalcin:2009aa,
	Abstract = {A high rate of glycolytic flux, even in the presence of oxygen, is a central metabolic hallmark of neoplastic tumors. Cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis in order to satisfy their increased energetic and biosynthetic requirements. This metabolic phenotype has been confirmed in human studies using positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-2-fluoro-deoxy-glucose which have demonstrated that tumors take up 10-fold more glucose than adjacent normal tissues in vivo. The high glucose metabolism of cancer cells is caused by a combination of hypoxia-responsive transcription factors, activation of oncogenic proteins and the loss of tumor suppressor function. Over-expression of HIF-1alpha and myc, activation of ras and loss of p53 function each have been found to stimulate glycolysis in part by activating a family of regulatory bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFB). The PFKFB enzymes synthesize fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) which allosterically activates 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), a rate-limiting enzyme and essential control point in the glycolytic pathway. PFK-1 is inhibited by ATP when energy stores are abundant and F2,6BP can override this inhibition and enhance glucose uptake and glycolytic flux. It is therefore not surprising that F2,6BP synthesis is stimulated by several oncogenic alterations which simultaneously cause both enhanced consumption of glucose and growth. Importantly, these studies suggest that selective depletion of intracellular F2,6BP in cancer cells may suppress glycolytic flux and decrease their survival, growth and invasiveness. This review will summarize the requirement of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases for the regulation of glycolysis in tumor cells and their potential utility as targets for the development of antineoplastic agents.},

	Abstract = {Cell proliferation requires a constant supply of lipids and lipid precursors to fuel membrane biogenesis and protein modification. Cytokine stimulation of hematopoietic cells directly stimulates glucose utilization in excess of bioenergetic demand, resulting in a shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism. A potential benefit of this form of metabolism is the channeling of glucose into biosynthetic pathways. Here we report that glucose supports de novo lipid synthesis in growing hematopoietic cells in a manner regulated by cytokine availability and the PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway. The net conversion of glucose to lipid is dependent on the ability of cells to produce cytosolic acetyl CoA from mitochondria-derived citrate through the action of ATP citrate lyase (ACL). Stable knockdown of ACL leads to a significant impairment of glucose-dependent lipid synthesis and an elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Cells with ACL knockdown display decreased cytokine-stimulated cell proliferation. In contrast, these cells resist cell death induced by either cytokine or glucose withdrawal. However, ACL knockdown significantly impairs Akt-mediated tumorigenesis in vivo. These data suggest that enzymes involved in the conversion of glucose to lipid may be targets for the treatment of pathologic cell growth.},

Such de novo lipid synthesis is necessary for membrane production and lipid-based posttranslational modification of proteins. A key enzyme linking glucose metabolism to lipid synthesis is ATP citrate lyase (ACL), which catalyzes the conversion of citrate to cytosolic acetyl-CoA.

	Abstract = {Protein kinase B (Akt) plays a central role in cellular regulation, although many of the physiologically relevant substrates for the kinase remain to be identified. In this study, we have isolated a protein from primary epididymal adipocytes with an apparent molecular weight of 125,000. This protein exhibited immunoreactivity, in an insulin-dependent manner, with a phosphospecific antibody raised against the protein kinase B substrate consensus sequence RXRXX(pS/pT) as well as a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes serine 21/9 of GSK-3alpha/beta. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed the protein to be ATP-citrate lyase, suggesting that the two phosphospecific antibodies recognize phosphoserine 454, a previously reported insulin- and isoproterenol-stimulated ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylation site. Indeed, both insulin and isoproterenol stimulated the phosphorylation of this protein on the site recognized by the phosphospecific antibodies in a wortmannin-sensitive and -insensitive manner, respectively. In addition, transient expression of a constitutively active protein kinase B in primary adipocytes mimicked the effect of insulin on ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylation. Furthermore, ATP-citrate lyase was phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant protein kinase B on the same site. Taken together, these results demonstrate that serine 454 of ATP-citrate lyase is a novel and major in vivo substrate for protein kinase B.},

	Abstract = {AKT2, an oncogene encoding a protein serine-threonine kinase implicated in phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase signaling, is amplified in some human ovarian and pancreatic carcinomas. We previously demonstrated that the tumorigenicity and invasiveness of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines with amplified AKT2 could be markedly reduced by transfection with antisense AKT2 constructs. To evaluate further the extent of AKT2 alterations in PDAC, {DNA} and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to assess amplification or overexpression of AKT2, respectively, in 72 PDACs. Thirty-five PDACs were subjected to Southern analyses, and AKT2 amplification was detected in seven tumors (20%). Forty-one formalin-fixed PDAC specimens were examined immunohistochemically with an anti-AKT2 monoclonal antibody, and moderate to intense staining was observed in eight tumors (20%). AKT2 immunostaining paralleled AKT2 genomic status in each of four cases in which both Southern and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. No obvious relationship was observed between AKT2 status and tumor TNM stage or grade. These observations suggest the utility of immunohistochemical analysis in assessing alterations of AKT2 in human cancers. Furthermore, the role played by the AKT2 kinase in the signaling pathways of various mitogenic growth factors implicated in the development of pancreatic cancer suggests that alteration of AKT2 may be an important component in the pathogenesis of a substantial subset of PDACs.},

	Abstract = {An abundant supply of extracellular nutrients is believed to be sufficient to suppress catabolism of cellular macromolecules. Here we show that, despite abundant extracellular nutrients, interleukin-3-deprived hematopoietic cells begin to catabolize intracellular lipids. Constitutive Akt activation blunts the increased beta-oxidation that accompanies growth factor withdrawal, and in growth factor-replete cells, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is required to suppress lipid catabolism. Surprisingly, PI3K and Akt exert these effects by suppressing expression of the beta-oxidation enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A). Cells expressing a short hairpin {RNA} against CPT1A fail to induce beta-oxidation in response to growth factor withdrawal and are unable to survive glucose deprivation. When CPT1A is constitutively expressed, growth factor stimulation fails to repress beta-oxidation. As a result, both net lipid synthesis and cell proliferation are diminished. Together, these results demonstrate that modulation of CPT1A expression by PI3K-dependent signaling is the major mechanism by which cells suppress beta-oxidation during anabolic growth.},

	Abstract = {Without receptor stimulation, cells from multicellular organisms die by apoptosis. Here we show that lymphocytes deprived of receptor stimulation undergo progressive atrophy before commitment to apoptosis. Following loss of receptor engagement, lymphocytes rapidly downregulated the glucose transporter, glut1. This was accompanied by reduction in mitochondrial potential and cellular ATP, suggesting that atrophy resulted from depletion of glucose-derived metabolic substrates. Expression of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-X(L), prevented death but not atrophy following either growth factor or glucose withdrawal. In Bcl-X(L) transgenic animals, size and metabolic activity of naive T cells were regulated through the TCR and correlated with TCR-dependent glut1 expression. These data suggest that ligands for cell-specific receptors promote cell survival by regulating nutrient uptake and utilization.},

	Abstract = {In yeasts, the glycolysis may display oscillations of its metabolites while it is converting glucose. The dynamics of the oscillations has been investigated in cytoplasmic extracts of yeast under relaxation type conditions by determining the time course of some of the glycolytic metabolites. The compounds of the nucleotide pool have been identified as fast variables and the glucose derivatives as slow variables of the relaxation type. The period of oscillation has been subdivided into four phases which represent prominent parts of the limit cycle in the phase plane of a slow versus a fast variable. From the reaction processes in these phases, a dynamical picture of the mechanisms of oscillations is suggested. Accordingly, the oscillation results from an alternating activity of the fructose bisphosphate and the polysaccharide synthesis, both of which are coupled to glycolysis via the nucleotide pool. The processes in the phases are analyzed by calculating the rates of the reaction steps in the biochemical pathway.},

	Abstract = {The dynamic behavior of metabolic networks is governed by numerous regulatory mechanisms, such as reversible phosphorylation, binding of allosteric effectors or temporal gene expression, by which the activity of the participating enzymes can be adjusted to the functional requirements of the cell. For most of the cellular enzymes, such regulatory mechanisms are at best qualitatively known, whereas detailed enzyme-kinetic models are lacking. To explore the possible dynamic behavior of metabolic networks in cases of lacking or incomplete enzyme-kinetic information, we present a computational approach based on structural kinetic modeling. We derive statistical measures for the relative impact of enzyme-kinetic parameters on dynamic properties (such as local stability) and apply our approach to the metabolism of human erythrocytes. Our findings show that allosteric enzyme regulation significantly enhances the stability of the network and extends its potential dynamic behavior. Moreover, our approach allows to differentiate quantitatively between metabolic states related to senescence and metabolic collapse of the human erythrocyte. We think that the proposed method represents an important intermediate step on the long way from topological network analysis to detailed kinetic modeling of complex metabolic networks.},

We compared results for 18 serum analytes with those obtained for specimens collected by the "dripping" method of capillary blood collection. The serum was examined microscopically for platelets and leukocytes from both normal and leukemic specimens. The cellular elements were all contained in the erythrocyte layer. Hemolysis was negligible. Means for paired samples did not differ significantly, except for Na+, for which the difference was not clinically significant. Values for potassium and lactate dehydrogenase were unchanged 24 h after collection, even though the serum was left in the collecting device.},

@article{Gerosa:2011aa,
	Abstract = {After about ten years of research renaissance in metabolism, the present challenge is to understand how metabolic fluxes are controlled by a complex interplay of overlapping regulatory mechanisms. Reconstruction of various regulatory network topologies is steaming, illustrating that we underestimated the broad importance of post-translational modifications such as enzyme phosphorylation or acetylation for microbial metabolism. With the growing topological knowledge, the functional relevance of these regulatory events becomes an even more pressing need. A major knowledge gap resides in the regulatory network of protein-metabolite interactions, simply because we lacked pertinent methods for systematic analyses - but a start has now been made. Perhaps most dramatic was the conceptual shift in our perception of metabolism from an engine of cellular operation to a generator of input and feedback signals for regulatory circuits that govern many important decisions on cell proliferation, differentiation, death, and naturally metabolism.},
